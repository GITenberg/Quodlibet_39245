<h2><a name="A_WORD_FROM_THE_AUTHOR" id="A_WORD_FROM_THE_AUTHOR">A WORD FROM THE AUTHOR.</a></h2>

<p class="p2">These annals were first published in 1840. They reappear
after an interval of twenty years. In that interval the old
questions which inflamed the zeal and sharpened the wit of
parties have totally disappeared from the political field: the
parties themselves have fermented into new compounds, and lost
all cognizable identity. Old warriors, who dealt mortal blows
on each other's sconce, have sunk to sleep in the same truckle bed,
and have waked up in mutual surprise to find themselves
in each other's arms, with a new flag above them, and new and
unaccustomed voices giving the word of command.</p>

<p>The youth who have grown up to manhood in the mean time,
and have come to be conspicuous in the conduct of public affairs,
compose a distinct generation, as unconscious of the events, the
interests, and sentiments of twenty years ago as of those of remote
antiquity. These not only reject the traditions and teachings
of the past, but repudiate and ignore the whole scheme of
social and political opinion of the men who have gone before
them, disdaining to adopt their maxims of government, their
policy, their forbearance, their toleration, or their affections.
They inaugurate a new era of new principles, new purposes, new
powers, new morals, and, alas! of new hatreds.</p>

<p>May it not serve a good turn toward arresting this torrent of
innovation, to present to the leisure meditation of those who are
embarking upon its stream, a few memorials of a bygone day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
quite as distinguished as the present for the intensity of its political
ardors and the absurdity of its excesses, but, fortunately,
more harmless and amiable in its temper? Is it not worth while
to attempt, by these playful sketches of the past, to lure the
angry combatants into a smile, and, by showing them the
grotesque retribution which history inflicts upon distempered
parties after a few decades of oblivion, to beguile them into
some consideration of the predicament in which they may leave
their own renown? May not all sober-minded lovers of their
country contemplate with some profit the <i>morale</i> of a picture&mdash;even
as light and extravagant as this&mdash;which represents the
engrossments of parties who fancied that the destinies of a
great nation hung upon the plots and counterplots of their busy
ferment,&mdash;which engrossments, with all their concomitant gravities
and glorifications, twenty years have shriveled into the
dimensions of a pleasant farce&mdash;a little stage imbroglio of comic
conceits and fussy nothings?</p>

<p>That intrepidity of absurdity which no responsible individual
would dare to countenance in his own conduct, and which is
only possible to organized bodies propelled by the ardor of party
enthusiasm, is a fact in human action worth the study of the
philosopher. By some unexplored tidal law, parties would seem
to move through successive ebb and flow toward a final culmination
of mischievous extreme, each refluent wave returning
with heavier mass, until the accumulated weight of madness and
folly overtopples, breaks, and dissolves in noisy foam. As we
have a computed cycle of a money-crisis, the known result of an
increasing and rapid prosperity ill used, so also we have the
regularly recurring political crisis, the result of increasing party-power
abused by rash and insolent presumption upon its
strength.</p>

<p>This century has run out its three periods of twenty years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
The first ended in the total absorption of all differences of
opinion, bringing a stagnant calm upon the waters of ancient
strife. The second culminated in a revolution that shook a
great party out of its seat;&mdash;a revolution which these annals
were designed to illustrate. The third period has wheeled
through its course, to work another downfall and another revolution
more notable and significant than either that have gone
before. The fourth, let us hope, may find a nation restored to
reason;&mdash;a great united Republic, tried and purified by the experience
of dangers incurred and surmounted, and by an
awakened patriotism successfully asserting the predominance
of the good sense and virtue of the people over the factious
spirit that ministers to personal ambition, and the vanity that
seeks renown in innovations upon either the principles in which
the Union was formed, or the sentiment by which it is to be preserved.</p>

<p>But these reflections are tending toward a graver subject
than it would be becoming to discuss here. So, I leave them
for some more appropriate occasion. If I have any reason to
fear the annals of Quodlibet may find no favor with the emerging
generation, I can make sure of another class of readers to
whom I look with a staunch and unfaltering trust;&mdash;that goodly
host of ripe and considerate citizens, the survivors of 1840&mdash;that
salt of the earth, who live on the past, and reckon old
memories to be better than a fresh and damp morning journal.
To you, old friends, bald on the crown, gray and feathery about
the temples, with jovial glance of the eye, showing a heart made
kind by trials, and who love your country with an affection that
grows out of the straits in which you have seen her, and the
faith you have that Providence has helped her through them,
and will help her through many more: to you, seasoned and made
jocund by time, and who, both as supporters and antagonists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
have run through the career of passion and delusion, and outlived
the wrath, the cunning, and the falsehood, the grandiloquent
fervor and exaggerated importance of the old political
quarrels; to you I dedicate this new edition of this book and
consign it to your protection, with the affectionate trust of a
fellow-soldier, (whether as comrade or opponent,&mdash;as kindly in
one character as the other,) in the whilom war of bloodless campaigns,
in which for years we were mutually engaged.</p>

<p>The astute reader of these annals, if he but truly analyze
their philosophy, may obtain a revelation more or less intelligible
of what is acting on the stage to-day, and even arrive at some
data by which he may cast a horoscope of the time to come.
History is constantly reproducing itself. Events have different
dates, and run in different names; but motives, human action
and passion, are the same, and bring to light the same categories
of thought and opinion. That which has been, is, and will be
again, through an infinite series of repetitions. Thus we read
the present and the future in the past. And in this light I
affirm the annals to be a fair and veritable history of this time.
Change a few secondary particulars, and the reader will find
1840 a type of 1860.</p>

<p>Would that in these grotesque absurdities of the busy world
of twenty years ago the men who shape and control the political
issues of this day may see some reflected images of themselves,
and thus find a motive to make interest with posterity for a
better report twenty years hence!</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Friendly Reader</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">Of a truth, we are a great people!&mdash;and most happy
am I, Solomon Secondthoughts, Schoolmaster of the
Borough of Quodlibet, that it hath fallen to my lot,
even in my small way, to make known to you how in
our Borough that greatness hath grown toward its perfect
maturity&mdash;feeling persuaded that Quodlibet therein
is but an abstract or miniature portrait of this nation.
Happy am I, although sorely oppressed with an inward
perception of my defective craft in this most worthy task,
that I have been thought by our Central Committee a fit
expounder of that history wherein is <i>enchrysalized</i> (if I
may be allowed to draw a word, <i>parce detortum</i>, from the
Greek mint) the most veritable essence of that recently
discovered Democratic theory, for distinction called the
Quodlibetarian, which is destined to supplant all other
principles in our government, and to render us the most
formidable and the most imposing people upon the terraqueous
globe.</p>

<p>How it came to pass that this duty has been committed
to my hands, you shall learn.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span></p>

<p>In the days of the late Judge Flam, now thirty years
gone by, and long before Quodlibet was, that very considerate
and astute gentleman honored me, a poor and youthful
scholar, with a promotion to the office of private tutor in
his family, then residing at their ancient seat in this neighborhood.
It was my especial duty, in this station, to
prepare Master Middleton, the eldest born, for college;
which in three years of assiduous labor was achieved,
much to my content, and, I need not scruple to affirm,
no less to my honor, seeing how notably my pupil has
since figured in high places among the salt of the nation.
Far be it from me to take an undue share of desert for
this consummation; it would be disingenuous not to say
that my pupil's liberal endowments at the hand of Nature
herself rendered my task easy of success.</p>

<p>By the aid of my early patron the Judge, whose memory
will long be embalmed in the unction of my gratitude,
I became, after Master Middleton was passed from under
my care, the head of our district school, which at first was
established in that lowly log building under the big chestnut
upon the Rumblebottom, about fifty rods south of
Christy M'Curdy's mill&mdash;which tenement is yet to be seen,
although in a melancholy state of desolation, the roof
thereof having been blown away in the famous hurricane
of August, 1836, just two years and ten months after the
Removal of the Deposits. This unfortunate event&mdash;I
mean the blowing off of the roof&mdash;it was the mercy of
Providence to delay for the term of one year and a fraction
of a month after I had removed into the new academy
which my former pupil, and now, in lineal succession to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
lamented parent the Judge, my second patron, the Hon.
Middleton Flam, had procured to be erected for my better
accommodation in the Borough of Quodlibet. Had my
removal been delayed, or the hurricane have risen thirteen
months sooner than it did, who shall tell what mourning it
might not have spread through our country side&mdash;who
shall venture to say that Quodlibet might not have been
to-day without a chronicler?</p>

<p>This long inhabiting of mine in these parts has afforded
me all desirable opportunities to note the growth of the
region, and especially to mark out the beginnings, the
progression, and the sudden magnifying of our Borough;
and being a man&mdash;I speak it not vaingloriously&mdash;of an
inquiring turn, and strongly gifted, as our people of Quodlibet
are pleased to allow, with the perfection of setting
down my thoughts in writing; and having that essential
requisite of the historian, an ardent and unquenchable
love of my subject, it has ever been my custom to put into
my tablets whatsoever I have deemed noteworthy in the
events and opinions of my day, accompanied by such
reflections thereon as my subject might be found to invite.
Some of these memorabilia, with discourses pertinent to
the same, have I from time to time, distrustfully and with
the proper timidity of authorship, ventured to contribute
to our newspaper, and thereby has my secret vanity been
regaled by seeing myself in print. By what token I have
not yet ascertained, but these lucubrations of mine were
not long ago discovered to our "Grand Central Committee
of Unflinching New-Light Quodlibetarian Democrats,"
who have been charged with the arduous duty of main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>taining
the integrity of the party in the present alarming
crisis, and of promoting, by all means in their power, the
indefeasible, unquestionable, and perpetual right of succession
to the Presidential Chair, claimed by and asserted for
the candidate of the great, unterrified New Democratic
school of patriotic defenders of the spoils. This Central
Committee now hold their sessions weekly in Quodlibet&mdash;and
having discovered my hand in the lucubrations to which
I have alluded above, they have been pleased to express a
favorable opinion thereon; and, as a sequence thereto, it
has occurred to them to fancy that my poor labors being
duly given to the compiling of such a history as my tablets
might afford of the rise and progress of the New Democratic
principle in Quodlibet, the same would greatly
redound to the advantage of the cause in the present
great struggle. Acting upon this suggestion, the Grand
Central Committee have honored me with a request to
throw into such shape as I might deem best these scattered
records of opinion and chronicles of fact, whereof I
was supposed to have a rich magazine.</p>

<p>Readily and cheerfully have I acceded to this request;
and with the more relish, as I shall thus be furnished with
an authentic occasion to present to the world the many
valuable thoughts and eloquent utterings of my late distinguished
pupil, and now beneficent patron, the Hon.
Middleton Flam, long a representative of this Borough
and the adjacent district in the Congress of the United
States.</p>

<p>I pretend to no greater merit in this execution of my
task than what an impartial spirit of investigation, a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
acquaintance with persons of every degree connected with
this history, an apt judgment in discriminating between
opinions, a most faithful and abundant memory, a careful
store of documentary evidence, an unalterable devotion to
the great principles of Quodlibetarian Democracy, and,
for the expounding of all, a lucid and felicitous style, may
allow me to claim as the chronicler of this Borough.</p>

<p>The better to assure you, my friendly reader, that, in
temper and condition, I may demand somewhat of the
confidence due to the character of a dispassionate commentator
on the times, I would have you understand that
I am now on the shady side of sixty, unmarried, and in
possession of an easy revenue of four hundred dollars per
annum, which is voted to me by our commissioners, for
instructing in their rudiments thirty-seven children of both
sexes; that I have a plate at the table of my patron, the
Hon. Middleton Flam, my former pupil, every Sunday at
dinner; and that he, being aware for some time past of
my purpose to treasure up his remarkable sayings, has,
with a generous freedom, often repeated to me many opinions
which otherwise would have been irretrievably lost.
Moreover, since I am now brought before the public under
circumstances in which reserve on my part would be no
better than affectation, I would also advertise my indulgent
reader of the fact that I belong to the Quodlibetarian
New-Light Club, whereof I some time officiated as Secretary,
and which club generally meets on Saturday night at
Ferret's; that the members of the same, noting my staidness
of deportment and the careful deliberation with which
I guard myself in the utterance of any discourse, do fre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>quent
honor to the temperance of my judgment by making
me the arbiter of such casual controversies as arise therein,
touching the true import and application of the principles
of our New-Light Democracy; and&mdash;if I run no risk of
being charged with offering a trivial evidence of the reputation
I have earned in the club&mdash;I would also mention,
that some of our light wags have gone so far&mdash;facetiously
and with a commendable good nature, knowing that I
would not take it ill, as more peevish men might, in their
jocular pleasantry&mdash;as to call me, in allusion to my natural
sedateness, <span class="smcap">Sober Secondthoughts</span>:&mdash;the rogues!</p>

<p>And now, amiable and considerate reader, you have
"ab imo pectore" my honest avouch for what I propose
to lay before you, and a plain confession of my weaknesses.
I come with a clean breast to the confessional. We shall
have a frugal banquet of it, but the fruits, I make bold to
promise, shall be wholesome and of the best. Now turn
we to it in good earnest. If this little chronicle&mdash;for my
book shall not be overgrown and apoplectic, but rather, as
you shall find it, "garrulous and thin"&mdash;do not bring you
to a profound sense of the value of this Amaranth of
Republicanism, the New-Light Quodlibetarian Democracy,
then say it to my teeth, there is no virtue in <span class="smcap">Sober
Secondthoughts</span>. Go thy ways&mdash;"The wise man's eyes
are in his head, but the fool walketh in darkness."</p>

<p class="chapt-summary smaller">ANTIQUITIES OF QUODLIBET&mdash;MICHAEL GRANT'S TANYARD DESTROYED
BY THE CANAL&mdash;CONSEQUENCES OF THIS EVENT&mdash;TWO DISTINGUISHED
INDIVIDUALS TAKE UP THEIR RESIDENCE IN THE BOROUGH&mdash;ESTABLISHMENT
OF THE PATRIOTIC COPPERPLATE BANK&mdash;CIRCUMSTANCES
WHICH LED TO AND FOLLOWED THAT MEASURE&mdash;MICHAEL
GRANT'S OBJECTIONS TO IT.</p>

<p class="p2">It was at the close of the year 1833, or rather, I
should say, at the opening of the following spring,
that our Borough of Quodlibet took that sudden leap to
greatness which has, of late, caused it to be so much
talked about. Our folks are accustomed to set this
down to the Removal of the Deposits. Indeed, until
that famous event, Quodlibet was, as one might say
in common parlance, a place not worth talking about&mdash;it
might hardly be remarked upon the maps. But
since that date, verily, like Jeshurun, it has waxed fat.
It has thus come to pass that "The Removal" is a
great epoch in our annals&mdash;our Hegira&mdash;the A. U. C.
of all Quodlibetarians.</p>

<p>Michael Grant, a long time ago&mdash;that is to say,
full twenty years&mdash;had a tanyard on Rumblebottom
Creek, occupying the very ground which is now covered
by the canal basin. Even as far back as that day he
had laid up, out of the earnings of his trade, a snug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
sum of money, which sufficed to purchase the farm
where he now lives at the foot of the Hogback. Quodlibet,
or that which now is Quodlibet, was then as
nothing. Michael's dwelling house and tanyard, Abel
Brawn's blacksmith-shop, Christy M'Curdy's mill, and
my school-house, made up the sum-total of the settlement.
It is now ten years, or hard on to it, since the
commissioners came this way and put the cap-sheaf on
Michael's worldly fortune by ruining his tanyard and
breaking up his business, whereof the damage was so
taken to heart by the jury that, in their rage against
internal improvements, they brought in a verdict which
doubled Mr. Grant's estate in ready money, besides
leaving him two acres of town lots bordering on the
basin, and which, they say, are worth more to-day than
the whole tanyard with its appurtenances ever was
worth in its best time. This verdict wrought a strange
appetite in our county, among the landholders, to be
ruined in the same way; and I truly believe it was a
chief cause of the unpopularity of internal improvements
in this neighborhood, that the commissioners
were only able to destroy the farms on the lowlands&mdash;which
fact, it was said, brought down the price of the
uplands on the whole line of the canal, besides creating
a great deal of ill humor among all who were out of
the way of being damaged.</p>

<p>With the money which this verdict brought him, Mr.
Grant improved a part of his two acres&mdash;which he was
persuaded to cut up into town lots&mdash;by building the
brick tavern, and the store that stands next door to it.
These were the first buildings of any note in Quodlibet,
and are generally supposed to have given rise to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
incorporation of the Borough by the Legislature. Jesse
Ferret took a lease of the tavern as soon as it was
finished, and set up the sign of "The Hero"&mdash;meaning
thereby General Jackson&mdash;which, by-the-by, was the
first piece of historical painting that the celebrated
Quipes ever attempted. The store was rented by
Frederick Barndollar for his son Jacob, who was just
then going to marry Ferret's daughter Susan, and open
in the Iron and Flour Forwarding and Commission
line, in company with Anthony Hardbottle, his own
brother-in-law.</p>

<p>This was the state of things in Quodlibet five years
before "The Removal," from which period, up to the
date of the Removal, although Barndollar &amp; Hardbottle
did a tolerable business, and Ferret had a fair
run of custom, there were not above a dozen new
tenements built in the Borough. But a bright destiny
was yet in reserve for Quodlibet; and as I propose to
unfold some incidents of its history belonging to these
later times, I cannot pretermit the opportunity now
afforded me to glance, though in a perfunctory and
hasty fashion, at some striking events which seemed
to presignify and illustrate its marvelously sudden
growth.</p>

<p>I think it was in the very month of the Removal of
the Deposits, that Theodore Fog broke up at Tumbledown,
on the other side of the Hogback, and came
over to Quodlibet to practice law. And it was looked
upon as a very notable thing, that, in the course of the
following winter, Nicodemus Handy should have also
quitted Tumbledown and brought his sign, as a lottery
agent, to Quodlibet, and set up that business in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Borough. There was a wonderful intimacy struck up
between him and Fog, and a good many visits were
made by Nicodemus during the fall, before he came
over to settle. Our people marveled at this matter,
and were not a little puzzled to make out the meaning
of it, knowing that Nicodemus Handy was a shrewd
man, and not likely, without some good reason for it,
to strike up a friendship with a person so little given
to business as Theodore Fog, against whom I desire to
say nothing, holding his abilities in great respect, but
meaning only to infer that as Theodore is considered
high-flown in his speech, and rather too fond of living
about Ferret's bar-room, it was thought strange that
Nicodemus, who is plain spoken, and of the Temperance
principle, should have taken up with him. It
was not long after Mr. Handy had seated himself in
Quodlibet, and placed his sign at the door of a small
weather-boarded office, ten feet by twelve, and within
a stone-throw of Fog's, before the public were favored
with an insight into the cause of this intimacy between
these two friends. This was disclosed in a plan for
establishing The Patriotic Copperplate Bank of Quodlibet,
the particulars whereof were made known at a
meeting held in the dining-room of "The Hero" one
evening in March, when Theodore Fog made a flowery
speech on the subject to ten persons, counting Ferret
and Nim Porter the bar-keeper. The capital of the
bank was proposed to be half a million, and the stock
one hundred dollars a share, of which one dollar was
to be paid in, and the remainder to be secured by promissory
notes, payable on demand, if convenient.</p>

<p>This excellent scheme found many supporters; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
accordingly, when the time came for action, the whole
amount was subscribed by Handy and Fog and ten of
their particular friends, who had an eye to being
directors and officers of the bank&mdash;to whom might
also be added about thirty boatmen, who, together
with the boys of my academy, lent their names to Mr.
Handy.</p>

<p>Through the liberality of Fog, the necessary cash
was supplied out of three hundred dollars, the remains
of a trust fund in his hands belonging to a family
of orphans in the neighborhood of Tumbledown,
who had not yet had occasion to know from their attorney,
the said Theodore Fog himself, of their success
in a cause relating to this fund which had been
gained some months before. As Nicodemus managed
the subscriptions, which indeed he did with wonderful
skill, these three hundred dollars went a great way in
making up the payments on considerably more than
the majority of the stock: and this being adjusted, he
undertook a visit to the Legislature, where, through the
disinterested exertions of some staunch Democratic
friends, he procured a most unexceptionable charter
for the bank, full of all sorts of provisions, conditions,
and clauses necessary to enable it to accommodate the
public with as much paper money as the said public
could possibly desire.</p>

<p>In consideration of these great services, Nicodemus
Handy elected himself Cashier; and, at the same time,
had well-nigh fallen into a quarrel with Fog, who had
set his heart upon being President&mdash;which, in view of
the fact that that gentleman's habits were somewhat
irregular after twelve o'clock in the day, Nicodemus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
would by no means consent to. This dissension, however,
was seemingly healed, by bringing in as President
my worshipful pupil, the Hon. Middleton Flam, now
our member of Congress, and by making Theodore
one of the directors, besides giving him the law business
of the bank. It was always thought, notwithstanding
Fog pretended to be satisfied at the time with
this arrangement, that it rankled in his bosom, and
bred a jealousy between him and his associates in the
bank, and helped to drive him to drinking faster than
he would naturally have done, if his feelings had not
been aggravated by this act of supposed ingratitude.</p>

<p>I should not omit to mention that Nicodemus Handy
was a man of exact and scrupulous circumspection, and
noted for the deliberation with which he weighed the
consequences of his actions, or, as the common saying
is, "looked before he leapt"&mdash;a remarkable proof of
which kind of wisdom he afforded at this time. Having
been compelled by circumstances to live beyond the
avails of his lottery business, and thereby to bring
himself under some impracticable liabilities, he made
it a point of conscience, before he could permit himself
to be clothed with the dignity of a cashier, or even to
place a share of stock in his own name on the books,
to swear out in open court, and to surrender, for the
benefit of his numerous and patient creditors, his whole
stock of worldly goods&mdash;consisting, according to the
inventory thereof on record, which I have seen, of a
cylindrical sheet-iron stove, two chairs, a desk and a
sign-board, this latter being, as I remember, of the
shape of a screen, on each leaf of which "<span class="smcap">Nicodemus
Handy</span>" was printed, together with the scheme of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
lottery, set forth in large red and blue letters. He
barely retained what the law allowed him, being his
mere wearing apparel; to wit, a bran new suit of black
superfine Saxony, one dozen of the best cambric linen
shirts, as many lawn pocket handkerchiefs, white kid
gloves, and such other trivial but gentlemanlike appurtenances
as denoted that extreme neatness of dress in
which Mr. Handy has ever taken a just pride, and
which has been so often remarked by his friends as one
of the strong points in his character. These articles,
it was said, he had procured not more with a provident
eye to that state of destitution into which the generous
surrender of his property was about to plunge him, than
with a decent regard to the respectability of appearance
which the public, he conceived, had a right to
exact from the Cashier of the Patriotic Copperplate
Bank of Quodlibet. All right-minded persons will
naturally commend this prudence, and applaud Mr.
Handy's sense of the dignity proper to so important
and elevated a station&mdash;a station which Theodore Fog,
in his speech at "The Hero," so appropriately eulogized
as one "of financial, fiscal, and monetary responsibility."</p>

<p>There was one circumstance connected with the
history of the establishment of the bank that excited
great observation among our folks: that was the dislike
Michael Grant took up against it from its very beginning.
It was an indiscriminate, unmitigable, dogged
dislike to the whole concern, which, by degrees, brought
him into a bad opinion of our Borough, and I verily
believe was the cause why, from that time forward, he
kept himself so much at his farm near the Hogback,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and grew to be, as if it were out of mere opposition,
so unhappily, and indeed I may say, so perversely
stubborn in those iniquitous Whig sentiments which he
was in the habit of uttering. I have heard him say
that he thought as badly as a man could think, of the
grounds for starting the bank, and still worse of the
men who started it,&mdash;which, certainly, was a very rash
expression, considering that our congressman, the Hon.
Middleton Flam, was President and one of the first
patrons of the institution, and that such a man as
Nicodemus Handy was Cashier; to say nothing of
Theodore Fog, whose habits, we are willing to confess,
might, in the estimation of some men, give some little
color to my worthy friend's vituperation.</p>

<p>Now, there was no man in Quodlibet whom Handy
and Fog so much desired, or strove so hard, to bring
into the bank scheme as Mr. Grant. They made every
sort of effort and used all kinds of arguments to entice
him. Nicodemus Handy on one occasion, I think it
was in April, put the matter to him in such strong
points of view, that I have often marveled since how
the good gentleman stood it. He argued, with amazing
cogency, that General Jackson had removed the deposits
for the express purpose of destroying the Bank
of the United States, and giving the State banks a
fair field: that the Old Hero was an enthusiastic friend
to State rights, and especially to State banks, which it
was the desire of his heart to see increased and multiplied
all over the country; that he was actually, as it
were, making pets out of these banks, and was determined
to feed them up with the public moneys and
give them such a credit in the land as would forever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
shut out all hope to the friends of a National Bank to
succeed with their purpose: and, finally, that although
Clay and the Whigs were endeavoring to resist the
General in his determination to establish new banks in
the States, that resistance was already considered hopeless.
It was with a visible air of triumph that Mr.
Handy, in confirmation of this opinion, read from the
Globe of the 21st of December previous these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The intelligent people of the West know how to
maintain their rights and independence, and to repel
oppression. Although foiled in the beginning, every
Western State is about to establish a State bank institution.
They are resolved to avail themselves of their
own State credit, as well as of the National credit, to
maintain a currency independent of foreign control.
Mr. Clay's presses in Kentucky begin now to feel how
vain are all their efforts to resist the determination of
the people of the West. Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri,
and Kentucky are resolved to take care of themselves,
and no longer depend on the kind guardianship
of Biddle, Clay &amp; Co."</p></div>

<p>Having laid this fact before Mr. Grant, by way of
clinching the argument Mr. Handy pulled out of his
pocket a letter which he had just received from the
Secretary of the Treasury. It contained a communication
of the deepest import to the future fortunes of
our Borough; which communication, as I have been
favored by Mr. Handy with a copy, I feel happy to
transcribe here for the edification of my reader. It is
a circular, and came to our cashier printed on gilt-edged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
letter-paper, having the title of the bank, the
date, and some other items filled up in writing.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Treasury Department</span>, <i>April</i> 1, 1834.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>:&mdash;The Patriotic Copperplate Bank of Quodlibet
has been selected by this Department as the
depository of the public money collected in Quodlibet
and its vicinity; and the Marshal will hand you the
form of a contract proposed to be executed, with a
copy of his instructions from this Department. In
selecting your institution as one of the fiscal agents of
the government, I not only rely on its solidity and
established character, as affording a sufficient guarantee
for the safety of the public money intrusted to its
keeping, but I confide also in its disposition to adopt
the most liberal course which circumstances will admit
toward other moneyed institutions generally, and particularly
those in your vicinity. The deposits of the
public money will enable you to afford increased facilities
to commerce, and to extend your accommodations
to individuals; and as the duties which are payable to
the government arise from the business and enterprise
of the merchants engaged in foreign trade, it is but
reasonable that they should be preferred in the additional
accommodations which the public deposits will
enable your institution to give, whenever it can be done
without injustice to the claims of other classes of the
community.</p>

<p>"There, sir," said Mr. Handy, after he had read
this paper to Mr. Grant&mdash;"read that over again and
tell me if there is any Quodlibetarian that ought not
to rejoice in this great event, and lend his endeavors,
with both heart and soul, to promote and sustain an institution
so favored by the government. The Secretary,
you perceive, has confidence in the 'solidity and established
character' of our bank&mdash;how can you refuse
<i>your</i> confidence after that? Sir, the Secretary is an
honor to the Democracy of Quodlibet:&mdash;what does he
say? Does he tell us to keep the public moneys
locked up only for the selfish purposes of the government?
Oh no: far from it; 'the deposits' says he,
'will enable you to afford increased facilities to commerce,
and to extend your accommodations to individuals.'
Mark that! there's a President and Secretary
for you! True friends, Mr. Grant&mdash;true friends
to the people. How careful are they of our great
mercantile and trading classes! Sir, the government
cannot do too much for such people as we are&mdash;that's
the true Democratic motto&mdash;we <i>expect</i> a great deal&mdash;but
they outrun our expectations. No more low prices
for grain, Mr. Grant&mdash;no more scarcity of money:&mdash;accommodation
is the word&mdash;better currency is the
word&mdash;high prices, good wages and plenty of work is
the word now-a-days. We shall have a city here before
you can cleverly turn yourself round. Depend upon
it, sir, we are destined to become a great, glorious, and
immortal people."</p>

<p>"Sir," said Theodore Fog, interposing at this moment,
with a look that wore a compound expression of
thoughtful sternness and poetical frenzy&mdash;"when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
historic muse shall hereafter contemplate the humble
origin of Quodlibet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fog," interrupted Nicodemus, somewhat petulantly&mdash;and
I feel sorry to be obliged to record this inconsiderate
language&mdash;"Blame the historic muse!&mdash;we
are now on business."</p>

<p>"As a director, sir," replied Fog, with a subdued
air, but with a dignified gravity, "I have a <i>right</i> to
speak. I meant to say, sir, in plain phrase, that
Quodlibet must inevitably, from this day forth, under
the proud auspices of democratic principles&mdash;obedient
to that native impulse which the profound statesmanship
of this people-sustaining and people-sustained
administration has imparted to it, soar aloft to place
herself upon the proud pinnacle of commercial prosperity,
wealth, and power. I have no doubt, Mr.
Grant, your tavern lot will increase to three times its
present value. You <i>ought</i> to take stock;&mdash;let me tell
you, sir, as a citizen of Quodlibet, you ought. As to
the cash, that's a bagatelle. Handy and I can let you
have any number of shares on your own terms. Flam
will do anything we say to let you in. By-the-by, he
got us the deposits. Flam's a man of influence&mdash;but
whether on the whole he will make us the best President
we could have procured, is perhaps somewhat
apocryphal."</p>

<p>"You cannot fail to see," said Mr. Handy, "that
we must all make our fortunes, if the government is
only true to its word; and who can doubt it will be
true? We start comparatively with nothing, I may
say, speaking of myself&mdash;absolutely with nothing. We
shall make a large issue of paper, predicated upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
deposits; we shall accommodate everybody, as the
Secretary desires&mdash;of course, not forgetting our friends,
and more particularly ourselves:&mdash;we shall pay, in this
way, our stock purchases. You may run up a square
of warehouses on the Basin; I will join you as a partner
in the transaction, give you the plan of operations,
furnish architectural models, supply the funds, et cetera,
et cetera. We will sell out the buildings at a hundred
per cent. advance before they are finished; Fog here
will be the purchaser. We have then only to advertise
in the papers this extraordinary rise of property in
Quodlibet&mdash;procure a map to be made of our new city;
get it lithographed, and immediately sell the lots on
the Exchange of New York at a most unprecedented
valuation. My dear sir, I have just bought a hundred
acres of land adjoining the Borough, with an eye to
this very speculation. You shall have an interest of
one-half in this operation at a reasonable valuation&mdash;I
shall want but a small profit, say two hundred per cent.&mdash;a
mere trifle&mdash;in consideration of my labors in laying
it off into streets, lanes, and alleys;&mdash;and if there
is any convenience in it to you&mdash;although I know you
are a moneyed man&mdash;you have only to make a proposal
for a slice of accommodation&mdash;just drop a note now
and then into the discount box. You understand. The
Secretary will be delighted, my dear sir, to hear of our
giving an accommodation to you. But there's one
thing, Mr. Grant, I must not forget to remark&mdash;the
Secretary, in fact, makes it a sort of <i>sine qua non</i>&mdash;you
must come out a genuine&mdash;declare yourself a
Whole Hog&mdash;and go for Flam in the fall elections.
The Secretary expects, you know," and as he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
this he laid his finger significantly upon his nose,
"that the accommodation principle&mdash;is to be measurably&mdash;extended&mdash;in
proportion to the&mdash;Democracy&mdash;of
the applicants. You understand?&mdash;a word to the
wise&mdash;that's all. It couldn't be expected, you perceive,
that we, holding the deposits, should be quite as
favorable to the Whigs, who rather charge us with experimenting
on the currency&mdash;you know&mdash;and who, in
fact, don't scruple to say that our banking system will
be a failure&mdash;it couldn't be expected we should be as
bountiful to them as to those who go with us in building
up this concatenation&mdash;tweedle dum and tweedle
dee, you know, betwixt you and me;&mdash;but it's made a
point of&mdash;and has its effect on ulterior expectations&mdash;you
understand. The long and the short is, without
being mealy-mouthed, we must prefer the old Hero's
friends;&mdash;but, after all, that's a small matter:&mdash;be a
Democrat, and go for Flam!"</p>

<p>"Flam and the immutable principles of civil liberty!"
said Fog, with great animation. "Middleton Flam, the
embodiment and personification of those deep and profound
truths, based upon the eternal distinctions of the
greatest good to the greatest number! Diffusive wealth,
combined capital, increased facilities to commerce, and
accommodation to individuals&mdash;there is the <i>multum in
parvo</i> of General Jackson's Democratic creed!&mdash;there
is the glorious consummation of the war with the great
money power, which, like Juggernaut, was crushing
down the liberties of our Republic!"</p>

<p>Michael Grant was a patient listener, and a man of
few words. He stood all the time that Fog and Handy
were plying him with this discourse, with his thumbs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
in his waistcoat pockets, looking down, with a grum
cogitation, at his own image in the water of the basin,
on the margin of which the parties had met, and every
now and then rocking on his heels and flapping the
soles of his feet sharply on the ground, denoting, by
this movement, to those who knew his habit, that he
was growing more and more positive in his opinion.
Once or twice he was observed to raise his head, and
with one eye half shut, seemed as if studying the
heavens. At length he broke out with an answer
which, from the vehemence of his tone, caused Handy
and Fog to prick up their ears, and gaze upon each
other with a look of incredulous surprise.</p>

<p>"Your bank, gentlemen," said he, "is a humbug.
Your speculation in lots, your accommodations and the
fortunes you are going to make, are humbugs. Flam
and the immutable principles of civil liberty are humbugs,
and the greatest humbug of all is your Democracy."</p>

<p>With these very rash and inconsiderate words, Mr.
Grant turned on his heel and walked away, leaving
Handy and Fog looking significantly at each other.
From that time Mr. Grant was generally considered an
enemy to our bank, and, as far as I can learn, never
had any dealings with it.</p>

<p>Mr. Handy set up a dry laugh as soon as Mr. Grant
was out of sight, and laughed on for some moments.
At last he said, somewhat mysteriously, and with a
great deal of deliberation&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fog, it's my opinion that the old tanner has cut
his eye teeth&mdash;what do you think of him?"</p>

<p>"He labors," replied Fog, "under a sinistrous and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
defective obliquity of comprehension; and from all I
can make out of this colloquy, I rather incline to the
opinion that he is not <i>very</i> willing to embark largely
in our stock." And saying this, Fog folded his arms
and looked steadfastly in Mr. Handy's face.</p>

<p>"Nor, as I should judge," said Handy in a kind of
whisper, "is he likely to join me in my speculation in
town lots. Fog, don't forget, you will indorse my note
for the purchase-money of that hundred acres&mdash;I shall
discount it to-morrow&mdash;I like to pay cash&mdash;that was
always my principle."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly&mdash;consider me a sure card in that
line," replied Fog:&mdash;"it is understood, of course, that
you reciprocate the favor on my purchase of the
meadow?"</p>

<p>"Without question&mdash;assuredly, Fog&mdash;one good turn
deserves another."</p>

<p>"Then, let's go up and take a drink," said Fog,
imitating the tone of a tragedy-player&mdash;"we'll call it
twelve, although my dial points but half way from
eleven."</p>

<p>"You know I never drink," quoth Handy.</p>

<p>"Then come and look on me while I that act perform,"
said Theodore.</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Nicodemus. And thereupon these
trusty friends went straight to Nim Porter's bar.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chapt-summary smaller">GREAT USEFULNESS OF THE BANK&mdash;SURPRISING GROWTH OF QUODLIBET&mdash;SOME
ACCOUNT OF THE HON. MIDDLETON FLAM&mdash;ORIGIN OF
HIS DEMOCRACY&mdash;HIS LOGICAL ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF THE
POCKETING OF THE BILL TO REPEAL THE SPECIE CIRCULAR&mdash;THE
DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE AS DEVELOPED IN THE REPRESENTATIVE
SYSTEM.</p>

<p class="p2">In the course of the first year after The Removal,
or as I should say, in the year One&mdash;speaking after
our manner in Quodlibet&mdash;the bank made itself very
agreeable to everybody. Mr. Flam came home from
Congress after the end of the long session, and found
everything prospering beyond his most sanguine expectations.
Nicodemus Handy had put a new weather-boarded
room to the back of his office for the use of
the Directors, and the banking business was transacted
in the front apartment where Nicodemus used to sell
lottery tickets. There was one thing that strangers
visiting Quodlibet were accustomed to remark upon in
a jocular vein, regarding the bank&mdash;and that was the
sign which was placed, as it were parapet-wise, along
the eaves of the roof, and being of greater longitude
than the front of the building, projected considerably
at either end. Quipes has been held responsible for
this, but I know that he could not help it, on account
of the length of the name, which, nevertheless, it is
due to him to say he endeavored, very much to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
discontent, to shorten, both by orthographical device
and by abbreviation, having painted it thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">The Patrioti<sup>c</sup> Coperplat<sup>e</sup> Bank Of Quodli</span><sup>bet</sup>;</p></div>

<p>notwithstanding which, it overran the dimensions of
the tenement to which it was attached. I say strangers
sometimes facetiously alluded to this discrepancy, by
observing that the bank was like the old Hero himself,
too great for the frame that contained it. And, truly,
the bank did a great business! Mr. Handy, who is
acknowledged to be a man of taste, procured one of
the handsomest plates, it is supposed, that Murray,
Draper &amp; Fairman ever executed, and with about six
bales of pinkish silk paper, and a very superior cylinder
press, created an amount of capital which soon put
to rest old Mr. Grant's grumbling about the want of
solidity in the bank, and fully justified the Secretary's
declaration of his confidence in its "established character
as affording a sufficient guarantee for the safety
of the public money intrusted to its keeping."</p>

<p>As a proof how admirably matters were conducted
by Mr. Handy, the Directors soon found no other reason
to attend at the Board than now and then to hold
a chat upon politics and smoke a cigar; and the President,
the Hon. Middleton Flam, having his October
election on hand, was so thoroughly convinced of
Nicodemus's ability, that I do not believe he went into
the bank more than half a dozen times during the
whole season.</p>

<p>It was in the course of this year, and pretty soon
after the bank got the deposits, that Mr. Handy began
his row of four story brick warehouses on the Basin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
which now goes by the name of Nicodemus Row. He
also laid the foundation of his mansion on the hill,
fronting upon Handy Place; and which edifice he subsequently
finished, so much to the adornment of our
Borough, with a Grecian portico in front, and an
Italian veranda looking toward the garden. As his
improvements advanced in this and the next year, he
successively reared a Temple of Minerva on the top
of the ice-house, a statue of Apollo in the center of
the carriage-circle, a sun-dial on a marble pillar where
the garden walks intersect, and a gilded dragon weather-cock
on the cupola of the stables. The new banking
house was commenced early in the summer, and has
been finished of very beautiful granite, being in its
front, if I am rightly informed by Mr. Handy, an
exact miniature copy of the Tomb of Osymandias: it
is situated on Flam Street, the first after you leave the
Basin, going northward. All the Directors, except
Fog, followed the footsteps of their illustrious predecessor,
Mr. Handy, and went to work to build themselves
villas on the elevated ground back of the Borough,
now known by the name of Copperplate Ridge,&mdash;which
villas were duly completed in all manner of Greek,
Roman, and Tuscan fashions. These being likewise
imitated, in turn, by many friends of the bank who
migrated hither from all parts and cast their lines in
our Borough, Quodlibet hath thereby, very suddenly,
grown to be, in a figurative sense, a pattern card of
the daintiest structures of the four quarters of the
world. Perhaps I may be too fast in making so broad
an assertion&mdash;cupio non putari mendacem&mdash;I am not
quite sure that, as yet, we have any well ascertained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
specimen of the Asiatic: but if Nicodemus Handy's
pagoda, which he talked of building on the knoll in
the center of his training course, had not been interrupted
by an untoward event, of which it may become
my duty to speak hereafter, I should, in that case,
have made no difficulty in reiterating, with a clear conscience
and without reservation, the remark which distrustfully
and with claim of allowance I have ventured
above.</p>

<p>My valuable patron not being resident actually
within the Borough, and being, as I have said, very
busy in the matter of his election during the greater
part of the first year of the bank, had not much opportunity
to devote himself to its concerns. But the
Directors, partly aware of their own knowledge, how
valuable was his influence with the Secretary, and
partly persuaded thereof by the Cashier, established,
with a liberality which Mr. Handy remarked at the
time was exceedingly gentlemanlike, his salary as
President at three thousand dollars a year&mdash;which
sum, Mr. Flam himself has, more than once in my
hearing, averred upon his honor, he did not consider
one cent too much. And indeed, I feel myself bound
to express my concurrence in this opinion, when I
reflect upon the weight of his character, the antiquity
of his family, the preponderance of his strong Democratic
sentiments, and the expenses to which, as President,
he was exposed in looking after the interests of
the bank&mdash;more especially in the journeys to Washington,
whereof I have heard him speak, for the purpose
of explaining matters to the Secretary.</p>

<p>Connected with this matter of salary, and as having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
a natural propinquity to the subject, I may here cursorily,
for I design to be more particular on this point
hereafter, claim the privilege to enter a little into the
family matters of my patron. And on this head, I
would observe that the household of Mr. Flam is large.
Of a truth, as some philosopher has remarked, mouths
are not fed, nor bodies clad, without considerable of
the wherewithal! There is Mrs. Flam, the venerated
consort of our representative&mdash;a lady most honorably
conducive to the multiplication of the strength and
glory of this land; there is, likewise, Mr. Flam's sister
Janet&mdash;truly an honor to her sex for instructive discourse
and exemplary life; and there is Master Middleton,
Junior, with his four sisters and three brothers,
who may be all ranged into the semblance of a step-ladder.
Great is Mr. Flam's parental tenderness
toward this happy progeny&mdash;the reduplication and
retriplication, if I may so express it, of himself and
their respectable mamma. Yielding to the solicitude
inspired by this tenderness, almost the first thing
which our representative did, after the establishment
of the bank&mdash;the means having thereby come the
better to his hand&mdash;was to send Master Middleton,
Junior, who was very urgent in his entreaties to that
point, to Europe, that the young gentleman, by two or
three years travel, might witness the distresses and
oppressions of monarchical government, and become
confirmed in his democratic sentiments. A refinement
of sensibility in Mr. Flam, which I might almost denominate
fastidious, has also operated with him to
require the education of his daughters to be conducted
under his own roof. He would never hear, for one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
moment, any persuasion to trust them, even at their
earliest age, in the public school&mdash;considerately fearful
lest they might form intimacies unbecoming the station
to which he destined them in after-life. They have
consequently been placed under the special tuition of a
most estimable lady, Mademoiselle Jonquille, a resident
governess, who is enjoined to speak to them nothing
but French. This lady, among other things, teaches
them music, and is aided in the arduous duties allotted
to her by a drawing-master of acknowledged ability in
water-colors, and a very superior professor of dancing,
who instructs them in the elegant accomplishment of
waltzing and galloping, which, Mr. Flam says, is now-a-days
held to be indispensable in the first Democratic
circles at Washington, where it has always been his
design to introduce the young ladies into high life.</p>

<p>It will not be out of place here to mention that the
worthy subject of this desultory memoir, my patron
and former pupil, inherited a large fortune from his
father, the late Judge Flam, who was especially honored
by old John Adams, or, as the better phrase is, the
elder Adams, with an appointment to the bench on the
night of the third of March, Anno Domini 1801; and
I have often heard Mr. Middleton say that his father
had, up to the day of his lamented departure from this
world, which melancholy event happened in the year
of our Lord 1825, the greatest respect for General
Jackson; which liking for the Old Hero descended to
his son, along with the family estate, and serves satisfactorily
to account for my former pupil's ardent
attachment to Democratic principles, as in the sequel I
shall make appear.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>I do not desire to conceal the fact that Judge Flam,
and even Mr. Middleton himself, for some years after
he came to man's estate, were both reputed to belong
to what was generally, at that time, denominated and
known by the appellation of the Old Federal party,
and what, in common parlance, has been sometimes
scoffingly termed The Black Cockade; and that the
Judge, who was always noted for being very stiff in
his opinions, maintained his connection nominally with
that party until the day of his death. I mention this
not in derogation of Mr. Middleton our representative,
but rather in the way of commendation, because I am
by this fact the more strongly confirmed in my admiration
of the greatness of his character&mdash;seeing that his
conversion to Democracy is the pure result of reflection
and conviction, which is more laudable, in my humble
thinking, than to be "a born veteran Democrat," as I
once heard a great man boast himself.</p>

<p>Now this conversion being a notable matter, I can
by no means pretermit a veritable account of it, which
happens to be fully within my power to disclose, I being,
as I may say, a witness to the whole course of it.</p>

<p>Everybody remembers that most signal of all the
literary productions of General Jackson's various and
illustrious pen, his letter to Mr. Monroe, dated the 12th
of November, Anno Domini 1816. It came&mdash;in the
language of my venerated friend, Judge Flam&mdash;like
the sound of a trumpet upon the ears of all of the Old
Federalists. "Now is the time," says General Jackson,
in that immortal letter, which I transcribed, as
soon as I saw it in print, into my book of memorable
things, and which I now quote <i>verbatim et literatim</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Now is the time to exterminate that monster called
Party Spirit. By selecting characters most conspicuous
for their probity, virtue, capacity, and firmness, without any
regard to party, you will go far to, if not entirely, eradicate
those feelings which, on former occasions, threw so many
obstacles in the way, and perhaps have the pleasure and
honor of uniting a people heretofore politically divided.
The Chief Magistrate of a great and powerful nation
should never indulge in party feelings. His conduct
should be liberal and disinterested, always bearing in mind
that he acts for the whole, and not a part of the community."</p></div>

<p>This letter of the last of the Romans was published in
the National Intelligencer, and I happened to be with
Judge Flam when it first met his eye. He was sipping
his tea. The venerable Judge read it twice; took up
the cup, and, in a musing, thoughtful mood, burnt his
mouth with the hot liquid so badly that he was obliged
to call for cold water.&mdash;Just at that moment, Middleton,
his son, came into the parlor: he had been out
shooting partridges.</p>

<p>"My dear Middleton, read that," said the Judge.</p>

<p>Middleton sat down and read it; and then looked
intently at his father, waiting to hear what he would
say.</p>

<p>"Middleton, my son," said he in a very deliberate
and emphatic manner, "There's our man. General
Jackson has been called a Hero&mdash;he's a Sage, a wise
man, a very wise man. <i>We</i> have been kept in the
mire too long: these Jeffersons and Madisons, and
Nicholases and Randolphs, and all that Virginia Junto
(I think that was the very word he used) have trodden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
us in the dust. They, with all the Democracy at their
back, have lorded it over us for sixteen years. We
owe them an old grudge. <i>But our time is coming</i>,
(this expression he repeated twice.) Remember, my
son, if ever you get into a majority, stick to it. Bring
up your children to it. You have a long account to
settle:&mdash;<i>I shall bequeath to you the Vengeance of the
Federal party</i>. We must rally at once upon Andrew
Jackson. He will bring <i>us</i> what it is fashionable to
call 'the people.'&mdash;We shall bring <i>him</i> the talent, the
intelligence, and the patriotism of the land. In such
an alliance how can it be otherwise but that we shall
have all the power?&mdash;and then, if we fail to play our
cards with skill, we shall deserve to lose the game.
Let Jackson be our candidate for the next Presidency,
and let our gathering word be, in the sentiment of this
memorable letter, 'The Union of the People and the
extermination of the Monster of Party.' Do not
slumber, my son, but give your energies to this great
enterprise."</p>

<p>Mr. Middleton took this advice of his venerable
father greatly to heart. "Up with Jackson, and
down with Party!" said he, after a long rumination;
"good, excellent&mdash;nothing can be better!" And
several times that night, before he went to bed, he
audibly uttered the same words, as he walked backward
and forward across the room.</p>

<p>From this time Judge Flam wrote many letters to
his friends, disclosing the views he had expressed to
Middleton; and by degrees the matter ripened and
ripened, until things were so contrived as to bring
about what Judge Flam used to smile and say, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
"a spontaneous, unpremeditated burst of popular feeling,"
in the nomination of the General. And the
Judge used to laugh outright, when the papers took
strong ground in the General's favor, as the candidate
who was brought out "without intrigue or party management."
The Old Hero and Sage, we all know, was
cheated out of his first election; which circumstance
greatly embittered his early friends, who, from that
time&mdash;Mr. Middleton among the rest&mdash;took a very decided
stand for Reform, Retrenchment, Economy, and
the Rights of the People.</p>

<p>The Judge did not live to witness this second effort
which resulted so gloriously for the Democratic cause;
but his son stuck close to the Old Hero, and was
among his most ardent supporters to the last. When
the General succeeded, his first care was to show his
gratitude to that disinterested band of patriots who so
freely surrendered their old principles and abandoned
their old comrades in his behalf. <i>He</i> brought <i>them</i>
into office, just to show that he was determined to
carry out the doctrine of his letter; and <i>they</i> were
loudest in their praise of <i>him</i> for the sake of the <i>old
grudge</i>, of which Judge Flam spoke to his son, and to
indemnify their long suffering in the cause of the
country, in the course of which they had, for so many
years, been strangers to power. So between these two
persuasions, it is not to be wondered at that they should
have become the principal friends and most confidential
advisers of the General.</p>

<p>Having thus got upon an elevation, from whence
they could look backward upon their past errors, and
forward to their future hopes, a new light dawned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
upon every man of them; and thereupon they straightway
became sick and sorry for having so long sinned
against Democracy, and grew ashamed of that black
cockade which George Washington wore in the Revolution;
made open renunciation of their former pretended
attachment to his principles; canonized Mr. Jefferson
as a saint, whom they had formerly reviled as the chief
of sinners; purged out their old Federal blood; took
deep alterative draughts of detergent medicine; and,
finally, like true patriots, came forth regenerated,
thorough-bred whole-hog Democrats, sworn to follow
the new Democratic principle through all its meanderings,
traverses, dodgings, and duckings to the end.
Indeed, Mr. Middleton Flam, our honorable representative,
has more than once, in some of his later
speeches before the people, contended, that although
his father was attached to George Washington's school
of politics, which, as he remarked, naturally arose out
of the prejudices created by the revolutionary war&mdash;in
which the old Judge had served as a soldier&mdash;yet, that
he, Middleton, never was truly an admirer of that gentleman's
theory of government or system of measures&mdash;but,
on the contrary, held them in marked disesteem, and
from his earliest youth had a strong inclination toward
that freedom from restraint, which, in man and boy, is the
best test of the new Democratic principle. In proof
of this tendency of his youthful opinions, he mentioned,
with most admirable effect, an exploit, in which,
when not more than twelve years of age, he gallantly
stood up at the head of a party of his school-fellows to
bar out the tutor and take a holiday, on the ground of
the indefeasible rights of man, with a view to attend a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
great political meeting of the friends of Jefferson, just
previous to the second election of that Apostle of Democracy.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, our distinguished member of Congress
is now, by force of reflection and conviction, as
pure, unadulterated, and, as our people jocularly denote
it, as patent a dyed-in-the-wool Democrat as Theodore
Fog himself, whose attachment to popular principles,
habits, and manners, and whose unalterable adhesion
to the new Democratic theory, are written in every line
of his face and in every movement of his body:&mdash;and
so, Mr. Flam avers, is every one of his black-cockade
friends who have got an office. "Thus it is,"&mdash;if I
may be allowed to quote a beautiful sentiment from
one of Fog's speeches&mdash;"thus it is, that by degrees,
the errors of old opinions are washed out by the all-pervading
ablution of the Democratic principle following
in the footsteps of the march of intellect; and so
true is it, that the body politic, like quicksilver, regurgitates
and repudiates the feculence of Federalism."</p>

<p>Nicodemus Handy has an attachment for Mr. Flam,
which is truly fraternal. It goes so far as to prevent
him from ever contradicting Mr. Middleton in any fact,
or gainsaying him in any opinion&mdash;although I did think
at one time, when Nicodemus was thought to be rich,
that he was a little bold in his sentiments on two or
three matters wherein our member differed from him.
One I remember in particular; it was when the Old
Hero pocketed the Specie Circular Bill. Mr. Handy
thought, for a little while, that the circular was too
hard upon the banks and the trading people, and he
seemed to insinuate that the General was rather cor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>nered
by Congress, when they ordered its repeal by
two-thirds of both Houses; and that, consequently, as
a good Democrat, he ought to have submitted to the
will of the people in that matter, and allowed them to
have the law after it was passed. Mr. Flam was
diametrically opposed to him, and proved, I thought
conclusively, that, according to the sound Quodlibetarian
Democratic principle, the General was altogether
right in putting the act of Congress aside and not
allowing them to overset his plans by another vote of
two-thirds. "For," he inquired with great force of
argument, adopting the Socratic form, "what is Congress?
The representatives of the people, by districts
and by States. For whom can any one man in that
body speak? For his own district, or for his own
State&mdash;no more. Now, what is the President? Sir,"
said he, in that solemn and impressive tone in which
he addresses the House at Washington, "the President
himself has answered that question in his immortal
Protest against the Senate&mdash;he is '<i>the direct representative
of the American people</i>,' and, as he took
occasion once to say in his Message, '<i>It will be for
those in whose behalf we all act, to decide whether the
Executive Department of the Government, in the steps
which it has taken on this subject, has been found in
the line of its duty</i>.' The President, sir, is the representative
of the <i>whole</i> people&mdash;not of a district, not
of a State, but of the <i>whole</i> nation. Why should these
representatives of <i>the parts</i> undertake to dictate to the
representative of <i>the whole</i>? It is for the people to
decide whether, in putting that bill in his pocket, he
was in the line of his duty. Sir, there is the broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
buttress upon which the Democratic principle reposes,
and will repose forever. Jackson has determined, as
representative of the people, that the Specie Circular
shall not be repealed, and every true Democrat will of
course say that he is right. I am surprised that you,
Handy, should give any countenance to the factious
doctrine set up by the Whigs, that Congress has a
right to array itself against the clearly expressed will
of the people, when uttered through the paramount
representative of the whole nation."</p>

<p>Mr. Handy was evidently confounded by this unanswerable
argument, and, of course, did not attempt to
answer. I confess, for my own part, I listened with
admiration and amazement at the dialectic skill with
which so abstruse a subject was so briefly yet so clearly
elucidated, and I inwardly ejaculated, in the language
of the afflicted man of Uz, "How forcible are right
words!"</p>

<p>My late pupil's reflections were drawn to this question
of the Specie Circular with more intensity of regard,
from a very natural train of circumstances,
which had great influence in inducing an elaborate
study of the subject. Mr. Handy has often said that
Mr. Flam was the very best customer our bank had
from the beginning. Acting, as he always did, upon
the principle that our first care is due to those who are
nearest to us, or, according to the adage, that charity
begins at home, the President of the bank refused
to borrow from any other institution, but determined
exclusively to patronize his own. This principle he
carried to the romantic extent of borrowing four times
as much as anybody else; and as he always contended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
for it as the most approved theorem in banking, that
the wider and the more remote the circulation of the
paper of a bank, the better for its profit, he employed
these funds in the purchase of a large quantity of the
Chickasaw Reserve lands. By these means Mr. Flam
became the proprietor of a vast number of acres in
that Southwest country; and as the Specie Circular
was a most laudable contrivance to stop overtrading
and speculating in the public lands, it occurred to our
worthy representative that the less the public lands
were sold, the more his would come into the market at
good prices; and so, with a view to the benefit of
Quodlibet, where he expected to invest the profits, he
became a strong advocate of the Circular. This set
him to studying the question of the pocketing of the
bill for its repeal, whereof I have spoken above, and
enabled him to convince himself how deeply that matter
was connected with the development of the Democratic
principle in the manner put forth in his argument
to Mr. Handy.</p>

<p>Thus does it come to pass that, step by step, as our
government rolls on, its fundamental features are successively
disclosed in the practical operations of that
sublime system which so securely intrenches the good
of the people in the doctrines of genuine Quodlibetarian
Democracy, as now of late, for the first time,
fully understood and practiced.</p>

<p>Ever after that notable discourse, Mr. Handy showed
himself, both in private and at our public meetings,
the stern, uncompromising champion of the Specie
Circular and of the broad representative character of
the President. The other questions upon which I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
found him to differ occasionally with Mr. Flam, shared
pretty nearly the same fate as this. The Cashier ultimately
fell into entire harmony of sentiment in all
matters with the President; though, as I have insinuated
before, in the flood-tide of Mr. Handy's fortune, when
he began to be accounted a man of wealth, he was, in
accordance with a principle of human nature founded
upon the corrupting and debasing influence of riches,
much more difficult to bring into perfect conformity of
opinion with Mr. Flam, than in the ebb. Yet, I would
here remark that, almost in the same degree that Mr.
Handy yielded his assent to the doctrines of the Hon.
Middleton Flam, did the rank and file of our sturdy
and independent Democracy yield to Mr. Handy; the
whole party being kept in a harmonious agreement
and accord by what Fog terms "the electric diffusion
of the Democratic principle through the whole circle of
hand-in-hand, unflinching, unwavering, uncorruptible,
and power-frowning-down yeomanry of the most virtuous
and enlightened nation upon the terrestrial
globe."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">Holding, as I do, our Democratic leader, the Hon.
Middleton Flam, in the most deservedly profound
respect, and knowing him to be, if I may be allowed
the expression, a bright exemplar of Democracy, and
containing in himself, metaphorically speaking, the
epitome of all sound opinions, I am fully authorized
by the common usage regarding public characters to
bring him and his affairs conspicuously into the view
of the world, not for censure, neither for praise,
although no man is better entitled to the latter, but for
instruction. Such is the destiny of distinguished men,
that their lives are common property for the teaching
of their generation. Duly acknowledging the weight
of this maxim, I shall venture in the present chapter
to give my reader a still closer insight into the private
concerns of our representative; for which task I feel
myself somewhat specially qualified, through the
bountiful hospitality of that excellent gentleman, who
has not only welcomed me to his board often on week<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
days, and always on Sundays, but who has even flattered
me, more than once, by the remark that he would
not take umbrage at such impartial development of his
life and opinions as he knew I, better than any other
of his friends, (truly herein his kindness has overrated
my worthiness,) had it in my power to make.</p>

<p>The old family seat of the Flams is about two miles
from Quodlibet. It is upon the Bickerbray road; and,
taking in all the grounds belonging to the domicile, the
tract is somewhere about eight hundred acres; by far
the greater portion of which is a flat range of woodland
and field, watered by Grasshopper Run, which
falls into the Rumblebottom. The tract used to be
called, in Judge Flam's time, "The Poplar Flats," and
the house, at that day, went by the name of "Quality
Hall:" but ever since Mr. Middleton has had it, which,
as may be gathered from what I have imparted in the
last chapter, has been from the time that the old Black
Cockades began to think of turning Democrats; ever
since that day the spelling has been gradually changing,
and the house now goes by the settled name of
"Equality Hall," and the tract is always written by
our people "The Popular Flats." Mr. Middleton
greatly approves of this change, for two reasons which
he has had occasion to take into his serious reflections&mdash;First;
"Because," he says, "in the Quodlibetarian
Democratic system, as now understood, words are
things." "Not only things, sir," said he, in a discourse
one day, at his own table, "but important and
valuable things. I have observed," he continued, "in
our country, especially among the unflinching, uncompromising
Democrats, that a name is always half the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
battle. For instance, sir, we wish to destroy the
bank; we have only to call it a Monster: we desire
to put down an opposition ticket, and keep the offices
among ourselves; all that we have to do is to set up a
cry of Aristocracy. If we want to stop a canal, we
clamor against Consolidation: if we wish it to go on,
it is only to change the word&mdash;Develop the Resources.
When it was thought worth our while to frighten Calhoun
with the notion that we were going to hang him,
we hurraed for the Proclamation; and after that, when
we wanted to gain over his best friends to our side&mdash;State-Rights
was the word. Depend upon it, gentlemen,
with the true Quodlibetarian Democracy, names
are things: that is the grand secret of the 'New-Light
system.'"</p>

<p>Mr. Flam's second reason for approving the change
in the spelling of Poplar Flats and Quality Hall, did
not depend upon such a philosophical subtlety as the
first; it was simply because he had very nigh lost his
first election to Congress from inattention to this material
point of orthography. Quality Hall, some of
the Democrats of our region were unreasonable and
headstrong enough to say, was not so Democratic a
name as their candidate ought to have for his place of
residence; and if it had not been that our representative
discovered this in time to convince them that it
was an old-fashioned way of spelling Equality Hall, I
believe, in my conscience, he would have made out
very badly: but luckily for this district, and I may
say, for the nation, this error in spelling was corrected
in time to set all straight; and Mr. Flam, from that
day, not only put the E before the Q, but, in token of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
that incident, and by way of a remembrancer, always
spoke of Equality Hall as built upon Popular Flats,
which sounded very well in the ears of the New Lights,
and no doubt went a great way to keep him in Congress
ever after. Therefore I repeat, after my patron and
friend, words <i>are</i> things;&mdash;and, democratically speaking,
in the sense of a New Light, I might even say
<i>better</i> than things.</p>

<p>Equality Hall is a building which looks larger than
it is, from the circumstance that it was originally a
one-storied, irregular cottage of brick, but in the
Judge's time a second story was put to it; and, almost
immediately after Mr. Middleton came to be the owner,
he enlarged the eastern gable by widening it to nearly
forty feet, and building it up considerably above the
roof, and then adding to it a grand Grecian Temple
porch with niches for statues, and with fluted Doric
columns of wood, which thus constituted what Mr.
Middleton calls his faade and principal front to the
building. The effect of this piece of magnificence was
to screen the old-cottage from view, and to impress the
beholder with the idea of a grand building peeping out
upon the Bickerbray road between the foliage of two
weeping willows, which the old Judge put there before
Mr. Jefferson's election.</p>

<p>I have heard some fastidious, not to say malevolent
critics, find fault with this new addition to the building,
upon the score that it had too much pretense about it;
and that one was always disappointed upon finding all
this grandeur of outside to be but a mere piece of theatrical
show, without having anything to correspond to
it within. Mr. Flam has heard the same objection, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
he has always treated it with the contempt it deserved.
"It <i>was</i> intended for show," he observed one day addressing
the people from the hustings, when he had
occasion to notice a remark of one of these caviling
gentlemen, who had said something about having walked
behind the portico to find the house&mdash;and I shall never
forget how his eye kindled and his form dilated as he
spoke&mdash;"Show, sir! Of course, it was put there for
show. What else could it be put for? What is any
portico put up for? It faces toward the road, sir&mdash;it
was designed to face toward the road. When I built
that portico, I wished the people, sir, to see it; the
best I have shall always be shown to the people. I
trust, sir, that my respect for the people shall never so
far abate, as to induce me to neglect <i>them</i>. My house,
sir, intrinsically is that of an humble citizen; there are
a dozen equal to it in this county; but that part of it
which is intended to gratify the people is unsurpassed
here or anywhere else. I have laid out, sir, a small
fortune on that portico to gratify the people: all that
I have comes from them&mdash;all that I ever expect to be,
I hope to derive from them: who has so good a right
as they to require me to put my best foot foremost,
when they are the spectators? On the same principle,
sir, when I appear in public, I dress in the most expensive
attire, I drive the best horses, and procure the
finest coach. My turnout is altogether elaborate,
studiously particular&mdash;simply because I hold the people
in too much esteem, to shab them off with anything of
a secondary quality, while Providence has blessed me
with the means of providing them the best. That, sir,
is what I call a keystone principle in the arch of Demo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>cratic
government: that is the sentiment, and that
alone, which is to give perpetuity to this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fair fabric of freedom," said Theodore Fog, who
was among the auditory, and perceived that Mr. Flam
hesitated for a word to convey his idea.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my friend," courteously replied Mr.
Flam, "I am indebted to you for the word&mdash;fair fabric
of freedom."</p>

<p>Coming back from this digression, which I have the
rather indulged because of the eloquence, as well as
the just Democratic sentiment it breathes, I proceed
with my sketch of the homestead of our distinguished
leader of the politics of Quodlibet.</p>

<p>If I were asked what constituted the most striking
feature in the arrangements of this very admirable
establishment, I should say it was the judicious admixture
of a laudable economy, with the greatest possible
effect in the way of outward exhibition. For instance,
the grounds were embellished with sundry structures,
apparently at great cost, and producing a most satisfactory
impression on the eye, but which, when examined,
would be found to be, for the most part, painted imitations
of a very cheap kind. Thus there was to be seen
from the portico, peering above a thicket on the Grasshopper
Run, an old castle with ivy-crowned battlements,
greatly enriching the view; at the end of the long
walk in the garden, a magnificent obelisk rose forty
feet above a bed of asparagus; the entrance to the
stable-yard was through the Gothic archway of an old
chapel, exceeding pleasant to behold; and the ice pond
was guarded by a palisade composed of muskets, lances,
swords, shields, and cannon, flanked at each end by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
pile of drums and colors. All these several embellishments
a nice observation would determine to be executed
in oil painting, upon wooden screens sawed into
the requisite figures. But even this expense would,
perhaps, have been avoided, had it not been that Quipes,
our artist, owed Mr. Flam twenty-five dollars on account
of a debt which Mr. Flam had to pay for him, to get
him out of jail, for the sake of his vote, when we first
elected our public-spirited representative to Congress.
Owing to this circumstance, connected with the fact
that Sam Hardesty, the joiner, became insolvent on his
contract for building the big portico, whereby Mr. Flam
was obliged to advance money to him in order to get it
finished, our member conceived that it would be a good
plan to work these debts out of his two friends, by
setting them about the decorations I have described.
Besides, he reasoned with himself that it was always
well to give employment to the working people about
him, with a view to encourage industry and afford a
practical illustration of the benignant influence of the
great Democratic principle upon society&mdash;a consideration
which Mr. Flam on no occasion ever permitted
himself to lose sight of. By this judicious management
he accomplished a fourfold purpose: namely, the beautifying
of Popular Flats; the execution of these rich
specimens of art, at less than half their value; the
employment of two very meritorious fragments of the
people; and, above all, a most satisfactory development
of the excellence and usefulness of the great
New-Light Democratic principle.</p>

<p>Mr. Flam never was what you might call a moneyed
man. For although his farms were very productive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
and he had a considerable income from stock in the
United States Bank; and although the expenses of his
family were very far short of what the world might,
from the show he made, suppose them to be; yet he
was in the habit of parting with his money as fast as it
came to hand. There were a great number of deserving
but needy persons who were often at the Popular Flats,
and who did not hesitate to borrow all the funds Mr.
Flam could spare, (if he had a fault it was the generosity
of his lendings,) and in this way to keep him,
as he has often told me himself, very bare. To make
sure against loss he had the prudence never to lend
without bond and mortgage, with a power of attorney
to confess judgment; and as he ever avowed what he
called his most irrevocable opinion, that the interest
law was exceedingly oppressive upon the industry of
the country, he invariably made his own bargain on
that point&mdash;sagaciously remarking, as I once heard
him to Nicholas Hardup, the cattle dealer, who was
under execution upon a judgment, and came to borrow
the amount from Mr. Flam, "Money, sir, is a commodity
like wheat or cattle; its value is regulated by
the relations of supply and demand. Society will
never prosper till that principle is universally recognized.
<i>We</i> go for it, Mr. Hardup, as cardinal in the
Democratic creed. Labor, to be free, requires that the
money contract also should be free. Why should the
poor man pay six per cent. when money is worth but
five? Why should he be prevented paying seven,
eight, or nine, even, if he finds it his interest to give
it&mdash;or cannot do without it? No, sir, Equal Rights,
Liberty of Conscience, and Unrestricted Freedom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
of Contract&mdash;there is the buttress of Democratic
government!"</p>

<p>It often happened, as such things will happen, that
Mr. Flam became the loser by his generosity; and as
it was a maxim with him to inculcate the most rigid
punctuality in all engagements, he has never felt himself
at liberty to relax what he regarded this salutary
rule; so that, on many occasions, he has been compelled
to submit to the unpleasant and expensive
operation of closing his accounts on the bond and
mortgage, by taking possession of the mortgaged
property; and in this way, as he sometimes feelingly
complains to his friends, he has become encumbered
with more land than he knows what to do with. He
has, however, gradually got through a great deal of
this trouble by renting out his farms; a course which
he intends to persevere in until his children are able to
take the management of them.</p>

<p>Mr. Handy has several times endeavored to persuade
him to make his improvements rather more permanent,
and to take down these embellishments I have been describing;
rather rashly as I thought, calling them, to
Mr. Flam's face, pasteboard scenery, gingerbread nonsense,
and twopenny gimcracks: and he insinuated
that if our worthy representative would lay out some
of his "accommodation" in a more solid manner upon
Popular Flats, it would tell hereafter to his advantage.
But Mr. Flam turns a deaf ear to all Nicodemus's
preaching. He says that the accommodation is better
laid out in the Chickasaw Reserve, where he means to
realize a large fortune; and as to what Mr. Handy is
pleased to call <i>gimcracks</i> and <i>gingerbread</i>, that, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
fact, is the only kind of decoration in which a man,
who respects the simplicity and purity of Democratic
government, ought to indulge his taste. "If," said he,
"my old castle, my obelisk, or my Gothic gateway
were built of stone instead of white pine, a fair inference
might be made against me of a lurking wish to
restore the exploded aristocratic system of primogeniture
and entails. It would be said I was building for
my son and his eldest born. Thank God, no such
treasonable design can be inferred from this <i>gimcrack</i>
and <i>gingerbread</i>, as you wittily term it. When I go,
sir, my estate is to be cut up as our Democratic republican
laws ordain; and my gimcrack and gingerbread
can be plowed in as easily as the dockweed. Strange
as it may sound to the ears of some, gimcrack and gingerbread
are the elements of our new Democratic
theory. Sir, our government should glory in it:&mdash;it
does glory in it. There is no reproach in the fact that
we neither build, legislate, think, nor determine for the
next generation. We attend to <i>ourselves</i>&mdash;that is
genuine New-Light Democracy. We oppose Vested
Rights, we oppose Chartered Privileges, we oppose
Pledges to bind future Legislatures, we oppose Tariffs,
Internal Improvements, Colleges, and Universities, on
the broad Democratic ground that we have nothing to
do with Posterity. Posterity will be as free as we
are. Let it take care of itself. I glory, sir, in saying
New-Light Democracy riots in gimcrack and gingerbread."</p>

<p>This eloquent outburst of sentiment effectually
silenced Mr. Handy, and brought him thoroughly into
Mr. Flam's opinion. I rejoice that my intimacy with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
this able statesman should have afforded me this opportunity
to show the brilliancy with which his mind
sparkles in the demonstration of political truth, and
the wonderful power with which it converts apparently
trivial thoughts into golden illustrations of the Democratic
theory as lately discovered and practiced.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p class="chapt-summary smaller">THE SECOND ERA&mdash;POPULATION OF QUODLIBET&mdash;INCREASE UNPARALLELED
IN ANCIENT CITIES; EQUALED ONLY BY MILWAUKEE, ETC.&mdash;SUCCESS
OF THE BANK&mdash;ATTACK UPON IT IN CONGRESS&mdash;THE HON.
MIDDLETON FLAM'S TRIUMPHANT VINDICATION&mdash;SKETCH OF HIS
CELEBRATED SPEECH BEFORE THE NEW LIGHTS&mdash;INIMITABLE IRONY
ON THE DIVORCE OF GOVERNMENT AND BANK&mdash;MERITED COMPLIMENT
TO THE HEAD OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY&mdash;THAT
DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN'S OPINIONS.</p>

<p class="p2">It is no part of my design in the compilation of this
little history to preserve the form of a regular, chronological
narrative of the course of events in Quodlibet;
for although the material for such a continuous
recital abounds in the memoranda which I have preserved,
yet it seems better to suit the purpose of the
respectable committee who have invoked me to this
labor, that I should rather make excerpts from the
mass of my papers, in such wise as to bring before my
reader the condition of the Borough at several epochs,
with an occasional reference to such incidents as may
serve to explain the opinions of our people and illustrate
the course of that beautiful system of politics
which the world&mdash;I mean that world of which our
Borough is the center&mdash;has consented to honor with
the epithet of Quodlibetarian; and in which designation,
in my poor judgment, is comprehended the essence
of the true theory by which this nation has advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
to its present unparalleled state of prosperity and
grandeur.</p>

<p>Following this suggestion, I propose now to lead my
reader to that epoch in the annals of the Borough
which dates in the fourth year after the Removal, or,
in the vernacular computation, the year of 1836-7.
The population of Quodlibet had now reached to the
astonishing amount of fifteen hundred and eighty odd
souls&mdash;the increase being altogether without an example
in the history of civilization, excepting, perhaps,
in that of Milwaukee, Navarino, and some other of
those seemingly incredible and fabulous creations of
art which are said to have sprung up under the beneficent
auspices of the Quodlibetarian theory, as the same
has been practiced in this government for some few
years past. Quodlibet, I repeat, had reached in population
upwards of fifteen hundred and eighty inhabitants,
as was ascertained by a diligent enumeration
made under the direction of our New-Light Club, with
a view to the election of a constable held this year in
the Borough;&mdash;and when we reflect that at the date of
the Removal, the whole settlement fell short of two
hundred persons all told, it will be perceived that in
three years our increase has exceeded seven hundred
per cent.! Verily, neither London, Athens, nor
Palmyra, Karnac, Luxor, nor even Milwaukee itself,
I doubt, has ever manifested so prolific an augmentation.</p>

<p>Nicodemus Handy's row of stores on the Basin was
the first improvement, as I have already informed my
reader; then Copperplate Ridge was studded with
buildings; at the same time Flam Street was enriched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
with the bank and seven brick buildings; then came
the Female Lyceum, with the Town Hall in the second
story of the same building, Peter Ounce's Boatmen's
Hotel on the other side of the Basin, the Hay Scales,
Zachary Younghusband's (the tinplate worker) shop,
and Dr. Thomas G. Winkleman's Druggist Store and
Soda Water Pavilion. These, as well as I can recollect,
were the principal establishments erected in Quodlibet
in the three years I have referred to. There were
a number of private houses built in this period, and a
whole settlement of free negroes made below the Basin,
on the line of the canal. I ought to mention, too, that
Nicodemus Handy this year dug out the foundations,
and, I believe, built the cellar walls, of a second row of
stores and of a new hotel designed on a very large
scale, with extensive baths to be attached to it. These
buildings, it pains me to say, in advance, never got
higher than the first story, as I shall be obliged to
relate hereafter.</p>

<p>The bank did a sweeping business all this time; and
nothing can be conceived more beautiful than the theory
upon which it was conducted. It has run out of my
memory how many new bales of pink silk paper were
turned off by it, but the amount would scarcely be believed
if I were to set it down; and the accommodation
principle was carried out to an extent that must have
been truly gratifying to the Secretary. Still, even this
most exemplary institution did not escape the malevolence
of the Whigs. That ever-complaining party,
as the Hon. Middleton Flam assured us by letter, were
making a great ado in Congress about all the banks,
but particularly about ours&mdash;alleging, in their usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
factious manner, that the government would lose money
by us, as well as by the others.</p>

<p>Deeming this charge as one of peculiar atrocity, we
at once determined to take it up in our New-Light
Club, and stamp upon it the most conclusive refutation.
We accordingly fixed an evening for the discussion,
during Christmas week, when we knew that our member
would be at home to visit his family; and he was
of course invited to attend and give his views upon
this very interesting question. The meeting was in
the Town Hall up stairs above the Female Lyceum.
All Quodlibet was present. I shall be long thankful
to Providence for the dignified station which it fell to
my lot to fill on that memorable occasion. By a most
unexpected but most felicitous chance, I was honored
that night with a call to the chair; the worthy Mr.
Snuffers, our President, not being able to attend, in
consequence of the interesting condition of Mrs. Snuffers.
As the subject of discussion was one of thrilling
interest, the most intense anxiety prevailed to hear the
speech of our eloquent representative. He came fully
prepared, bringing with him a load of documents. Our
Vice, Mr. Doubleday, who is a solid thinking, shrewd
person, of that maturity of judgment which it is impossible
to impose upon, and himself, by-the-by, a first-rate
debater, told me, after we broke up, that Mr.
Flam's discourse that evening on the banking system
at large and on the <i>safety</i> of the banks in particular,
was one of the closest pieces of reasoning he had ever
listened to in his life. I regret that I have preserved
so imperfect an outline of this speech, but such as it is
I offer it to my reader.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>The orator commenced very appropriately by remarking
how impossible it was, in the nature of things,
to satisfy the Whigs on any point. He said there
were three parties in Congress: First, the Whigs&mdash;who
still croaked about a National Bank&mdash;and his description
of their croaking was to the last degree
humorous; it produced peals of laughter. Second, the
thorough-going Quodlibetarian Whole Hogs, who were
steadfast and immovable for the State Banks; and a
third party, small in numbers, "attenuated"&mdash;as he
remarked with irresistibly comic effect&mdash;"and gaunt;
feeble, shrill, and like crickets who might scarcely be
seen in daytime;" and who, when the bill to Regulate
the Deposits was up, presented what, in his opinion,
was the most alarming, if it had not been the most
ridiculous scheme, in relation to the public money, that
had ever been hatched in the hotbed of faction. These
men, he said called themselves Conservatives: "And
what think you, Mr. President," he asked, "was
<i>their</i> project? It was, sir, to separate the Government
from the Banks." Here Mr. Flam was interrupted by
a loud laugh. "A Mr. Gordon," he said, "was at the
head of this little troop. He proposed a bill, two
sessions ago, to place the revenue and public moneys
in the hands of Receivers&mdash;the moneys were to be
paid to these Receivers in <span class="smcap lowercase">GOLD</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">SILVER</span>! and no
bank was to be intrusted with a dollar!! And this,"
exclaimed Mr. Flam, with a tone of inimitable irony,
"was to be done for the <span class="smcap lowercase">SAFETY</span> of the public Treasure!
Your money not safe in the hands of the
banks, but <i>perfectly secure</i> in the keeping of these
honest Receivers, who were to be furnished with vaults<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
and iron chests to lock it up in!!! O rare Conservatives!&mdash;O
wise Conservatives!&mdash;O honest Conservatives!"</p>

<p>We all thought the ceiling of the Town Hall would
have toppled down on our heads from the laughter
occasioned by this sally. In this admirable strain he
continued for some minutes. At length, taking himself
up, and falling into a tone of grave expostulation,
he pulled out a copy of The Globe from his pocket,
and proceeded&mdash;</p>

<p>"Admirably, sir, has this paper which I hold in my
hand descanted on this most wicked project. These
well-timed remarks, I beg leave to read. Hear the
incomparable Blair. '<i>Had such a suggestion</i>,' says he,
'<i>come from General Jackson, it would have been rung
through the Old Dominion as conclusive proof of all
the aspirations which may have been charged to the
Hero of New Orleans. See here, they would say, he
wishes to put the public money directly into the palms
of his friends and partisans, instead of keeping it on
deposit in banks, whence it cannot be drawn, for
other than public purposes, without certain detection.
In such a case, we should feel that the people had just
cause for alarm, and ought to give their most watchful
attention to such an effort to enlarge Executive power,
and put in its hands the means of corruption</i>.'
Most admirably again," continued Mr. Flam, "has
this same incomparable Blair said, '<i>The scheme is disorganizing
and revolutionary, subversive of the fundamental
principles of our government, and of its practice
from 1780 down to this day</i>.' Will you, freemen
of Quodlibet, gentlemen of The New Light," exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Mr. Flam, "if faction should go so far as to put this
odious, disorganizing, and revolutionary yoke upon
the country, will you, freemen of Quodlibet, submit
to it?"</p>

<p>"No!" shouted the ready response of sixty-four
voices.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, listen to the words of the Old Hero,"
continued Mr. Flam, with a gratulatory smile playing
on his face, presenting at the same time a printed
document which he carefully unfolded&mdash;"listen to that
'old man eloquent' whose mouth is never opened but
to breathe the precepts of wisdom and patriotism:&mdash;I
read you from his last message. In remarking upon
this absurd project, the President, in this able paper,
holds the following language: '<i>To retain the Public
Revenue in the Treasury unemployed in any way, is
impracticable. It is considered against the genius of
our free institutions to lock up in vaults the treasure
of the nation. Such a treasure would doubtless be
employed at some time, as it has in other countries,
when opportunity tempted ambition.</i>' Now are you
willing, men of Quodlibet," again ejaculated our eloquent
representative, as he slapped the document upon
the table, "are you willing, or can you consent to
tolerate a proposition which is against the genius&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" thundered forth sixty-four New Lights
again, before our orator had finished the sentence.</p>

<p>"Order, order, freemen of Quodlibet," I called
out, as it was my duty to do, at this interruption.
"Hear our distinguished representative to an end,
before you respond."</p>

<p>There was a decorous silence.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"A proposition," continued Mr. Flam, "which is
against the genius of our free institutions, and which
would be a lure to tempt ambition to its most unholy
purposes?"</p>

<p>The club looked at me for a sign, and I, quickly
giving a nod of my head, a loud "No" ran over the
whole room, like a <i>feu de joie</i> fired off at a militia
training.</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen," said Mr. Flam, "one word as to
the <i>safety</i> of these deposits. Whigs&mdash;oh that some of
you were present, to mark how a plain tale shall put
you down! I have here the Secretary's own report,"
he added, as he selected one from the bundle of documents
which lay before him. "There is no need for
many words here&mdash;here is Mr. Secretary himself, than
whom a more pellucid, diaphanous, transparent Secretary
of the Treasury&mdash;a mind of rock-crystal, a head
of sunbeams, a soul, sir, of pure fountain water, that
gurgles and gurgles, perpetually welling forth its
unadulterated intelligence in a purling stream, of which
it may be said, in the beautiful language of the poet
of antiquity</p>

<p>
'Rusticus expectat dum defluat amnis, at ille<br />
Labitur et labetur in omne volubilis vum'"&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>Here I gave a nod, by way of signal to the club, to
applaud this splendid outbreak of Ciceronian eloquence;
whereat the New Lights vociferated "Bravo&mdash;three
times three!" and made the house ring with their approbation&mdash;"I
say, sir, I have the Secretary himself
here present."</p>

<p>Several of the members, not being accustomed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
this parliamentary language, took the orator literally,
and rose to welcome the distinguished person referred
to; but a word from me explained matters, and brought
the club again to order.</p>

<p>"The Secretary, gentlemen New Lights," said Mr.
Flam, adroitly availing himself of the occasion to throw
off a coruscation of wit&mdash;"the Secretary lives <i>in his
reports</i>&mdash;profound, statesmanlike, recondite and deep,
his report is in my hand&mdash;<i>it is himself!</i> I will read
you what he says upon this matter of the safety of the
banks."</p>

<p>Here Mr. Flam read as follows, from a report dated
December 12, 1834:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is gratifying to reflect, however, that the credit
given by the government, whether to bank paper or
bank agents, has been accompanied by <span class="smcap lowercase">SMALLER LOSSES</span>
in the experience under the system of State banks in
this country, at their worst periods, and under their
severest calamities, than any other kind of credit the
government has ever given in relation to its pecuniary
transactions." "Again," he continued, turning to
another page, "it is a singular fact, in praise of this
description of public debtors&mdash;the selected banks&mdash;that
there is not now due, on deposit, in the whole of
them, which have ever stopped payment, from the
establishment of the constitution to the present moment,
a sum much beyond what is now due to the
United States from one mercantile firm, that stopped
payment in 1825 or 1826, and of whom ample security
was required, and supposed to be taken under the
responsibility of an oath. If we include the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
present dues to the government from discredited banks
at all times, and of all kinds, whether as depositories
or not, and embrace even counterfeit bills, and every
other species of unavailable funds in the treasury, they
will not exceed what is due from two such firms. Of
almost one hundred banks, not depositories, which,
during all our wars and commercial embarrassments,
have heretofore failed, in any part of the Union, in
debt to the government, on their bills or otherwise, it
will be seen by the above table (to which Mr. Flam referred
as annexed to the report) that the whole of them,
except seventeen, have adjusted everything which they
owed, and that the balance due from them, without
interest, is less than $32,000."</p></div>

<p>"There, gentlemen New Lights of Quodlibet," said
Mr. Flam, when he had finished reading these extracts,
"what can be added beyond this certificate from the
Secretary, of the value of our State banks? Even the
lips of Whiggism are sealed before it; and nothing is
left but the confession that, in all their senseless clamor
against our favorite and long-tried State bank system,
the course of its enemies has been but the ebullition of
disappointed ambition and peevish discontent. Are
you willing, I ask, to see this glorious system prostrated
to the earth?"</p>

<p>"No!" was again the general cry.</p>

<p>"Are you content to see your cherished banks
stripped of the confidence of the government?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;never, never!" shouted the New Lights to a
man.</p>

<p>"Then, gentlemen Quodlibetarians, radii of the New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Lights, you have justified all my hopes. Your applause
rewards all my toils&mdash;your support and confidence
enlist all my gratitude. With emotions of heart-felt
satisfaction, I bid you each good night!"</p>

<p>With these words, this remarkable man gathered up
his documents, and, with a countenance full of smiles,
retired from the midst of this circle of his devoted&mdash;yes,
I may say, his idolizing friends.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p class="chapt-summary smaller">EXCITEMENT PRODUCED BY THE THOROUGH BLUE WHOLE TEAM&mdash;MEETING
OF THE NEW LIGHT&mdash;JESSE FERRET'S AMBIDEXTERITY&mdash;INTRODUCTION
OF ELIPHALET FOX TO THE CLUB&mdash;HIS EXPOSITION
OF PRINCIPLES&mdash;ESTABLISHMENT OF THE QUODLIBET WHOLE HOG.</p>

<p class="p2">Soon after the time referred to in the last chapter&mdash;that
is, when we were favored by Mr. Flam with his
views on the banking system&mdash;there was a question of
the most profound interest in agitation, both in the
New-Light Club and out of it; that question was the
establishment of a newspaper. The Quodlibetarian
Democracy were, I am sorry to inform my reader, most
sorely and wantonly assailed, indeed I may say insulted,
by an hebdomadal sheet which, through the aid,
or, more properly speaking, <i>the abuse</i> of the post-office
(for surely it was not the original design of that institution
to afford the means of corrupting the people
by the dissemination of such moral poisons) was distributed
among sundry of our citizens, and even put
upon the files of one of our public houses. I do not
scruple to name the house&mdash;that of Jesse Ferret&mdash;Jesse
being at this time a little amphibious in his
politics, or, in Mr. Fog's expressive language, <i>rather
fishy</i>. The paper to which I allude was published at
Thorough Blue Court-House, a perfect hotbed of contumacious
opposition, situate about fifty miles due west
from Quodlibet. It was called "<span class="smcap">The Thorough</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Blue Whole Team</span>," and was edited by Augustus
Postlethwaite Tompkinson, an inchoate lawyer, who
had set up for a poet, and whose sentiments were of
the most dangerous Whig complexion. This paper was
constantly filled with extracts of the ravings of Whig
members of Congress against our admirable system of
banking, and had gone to such an extreme of rashness,
as to denominate that splendid measure of the purest
and wisest statesman of the age&mdash;my reader perceives
I mean Mr. Benton&mdash;for the introduction of the gold
currency, a humbug! But this was not all; the unprincipled
editor of that reckless journal had actually
so far forgotten all the decencies of civilized society,
had become so callous to the cause of virtue and truth,
as to launch his puny thunderbolts at the fair fame of
the Hon. Middleton Flam. He was ridiculed as a pretender!
he was nicknamed a charlatan!! and the
unbridled license of this unsparing defamer did not
stop short of denouncing him as a Federalist!!! All
Quodlibet&mdash;that is, all who possessed the soul of Quodlibetarians&mdash;raised
up their hands at the political impiety
of this libel. A spontaneous burst of feeling
indicated the deep sentiment which called for immediate
action on the subject. For a full week, the New Light
was in a state of paroxysm. The club met every
night. Nicodemus Handy was there; Fog was there;
Nim Porter was there; Snuffers and Doubleday, Doctor
Winkleman and Zachary Younghusband, recently appointed
postmaster of the Borough, were there. Every
thorough-bred Quod, even down to Flan. Sucker, was
there. Jesse Ferret, I have already said, was fishy.
I regret to say it, but it is true. Jesse, bending to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
suppleness of the times, and forgetting a patriot's duty,
which is first and foremost above all things to stick to
his party, pleaded his public calling to excuse his
vacillation, and even went so far as to say that "a
publican should have no politics." Oh shame, where
is thy blush! Not so with Nim Porter;&mdash;his soul
towered above the bar-room; he would bet all he was
worth on the side of his party. Everybody in Quodlibet
knows how free Nim always was with his bets.</p>

<p>The decisive meeting of the club took place in the
dining-room of Ferret's tavern. Nicodemus Handy
did not often attend the meetings of the club: we
looked to him rather for head work, for he was not
the best of public speakers; but on the night of this
assemblage he made it a point to be present. Mr.
Handy is rather a short, fat man; his head is partially
bald, his face is smooth and fair, his dress was always
remarked for being of the best material, put on in the
neatest manner&mdash;in short, Mr. Handy is a first-rate
gentleman. I am particular in noting these matters,
because <span class="smcap">The Whole Team</span> was in the habit of bragging
that "all the decency" was on his side. Now I
would challenge Thorough Blue Court-House, and the
settlement ten miles around it&mdash;the whole region is
Whig&mdash;to produce one man among them to compare
either with the Hon. Middleton Flam or Nicodemus
Handy. And I would take this occasion further to
remark, in refutation of <span class="smcap">The Whole Team's</span> calumny
touching "all the decency," that the true Quodlibetarian
Democrats have as great a respect for appearance,
and as profound a spirit of assentation and regard
toward a man of wealth, as the people of any country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
upon earth: if anything, our tip-top Quods carry
rather a higher head than the richest Whigs in these
parts, and any dispassionate man who will examine
into the matter will say so.</p>

<p>Snuffers was in the chair. The members of the club
did not sit down: they were too much agitated to sit
down. As soon as I, in my character of Secretary,
read the minutes of the preceding meeting, Mr. Handy
rose, and after some very appropriate remarks delivered
in a modest fashion, (in which he assured the club that
he was unaccustomed to public speaking and moreover
oppressed by the intensity of his feelings in regard to
the recent attack on his friend, the Hon. Middleton
Flam, and in a slight degree agitated in the presence
of this most respectable assemblage of Quods,) came
at once to the point. "Who," he asked, "was Augustus
Postlethwaite Tompkinson? His name told you who
he was&mdash;an aristocrat, a poet, a sentimentalizer, <i>a
dealer in fiction</i>! What was his calling? A pander,
a pimp, a professional reviler of great and good men.
What was his paper? That sink of infamy&mdash;<span class="smcap">The
Whole Team</span>&mdash;twenty-four by eighteen, with a poet's
corner, and an outside stuffed with a few beggarly
advertisements. Would gentlemen submit to be led
by the nose by a thing like that, twenty-four by
eighteen?"</p>

<p>"Never," cried out Flanigan Sucker, who stood in
the doorway, just behind Nim Porter&mdash;"will we, Nim?"</p>

<p>"Silence," said Mr. Snuffers.</p>

<p>"If gentlemen have my feelings of indignation on
this subject," continued Mr. Handy, "they will concur
with me in establishing a paper of our own."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go it, Nicodemus!" shouted Flan. Sucker, very
indecorously putting in his word a second time.</p>

<p>Thereupon arose some confusion in the club, and
Flan., being found upon examination to be muddled
with liquor, was requested to retire; and not being
very prompt to obey this invitation, he was turned out.</p>

<p>Mr. Handy then proceeded. "Gentlemen," said he,
"a paper we must have, and I feel happy in the opportunity
to introduce to your acquaintance a good
friend of our cause, who is here present to-night, and
who, under the auspices of this club, is willing to undertake
the responsible duty of supplying this so much
desiderated object. I beg leave to present to you Mr.
Eliphalet Fox, a gentleman long connected with the
press in a neighboring State, and who is prepared to
submit to you his scheme."</p>

<p>Upon this a stranger, who had been seated in a back
part of the room, wrapped up in a green camlet cloak
with plaid lining, which I may add had apparently
seen much service, stepped forward, and, disrobing himself
of this outer garment, stood full before the President.
He was a thin, faded little fellow, whose clothes
seemed to be somewhat too large for him. His eye was
gray and rather dull, his physiognomy melancholy, his
cheek sunken, his complexion freckled, his coat blue,
the buttons dingy, his hair sandy, and like untwisted
rope. The first glance at the person of this new-comer
gave every man of the club the assurance that here was
an editor indeed. A whisper of approbation ran
through the crowd, and from that moment, as Mr.
Doubleday afterward said to me, we felt assured that
we had the man we wanted.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. President," said he, in a feeble and sickly
voice, "my name <i>is</i> Fox. I am in want of employment.
Sir," he added, gritting his teeth and taking
an attitude, "if the rancor of my soul, accumulated by
maltreatment, set on edge by disappointment, indurated
by time, entitle me to claim your confidence, then, sir,
my claim stands number one. If a thorough knowledge,
sir, of the characteristic traits of Federalism, long acquaintance
with its designs, persecution, sir, from its
votaries, a deep experience of its black ingratitude;
if days of toil spent in its service, nights of feverish
anxiety protracted in ruminating over its purposes; if
promises violated, hopes blasted, labors unrewarded,
may be deemed a stimulus to hatred&mdash;then, sir, am I
richly endowed with the qualifications to expose the
enemies of Quodlibetarian Democracy. I am a child,
sir, of sorrow: the milk of my nature has been curdled
by neglect. Mine is a history of talents underrated,
sensibilities derided, patriotism spurned, affluence, nay
competence, withheld. The world has turned me aside.
I have no resting place on the bosom of my mother.
Society, like a demon, pursues me. Writs in the hands
of the sheriff, judgments on the docket, <i>fi. fas.</i> and <i>ca.
sas.</i> track my footsteps. No limitation runs in my
favor: the <i>scire facias</i>, ever ready, revives the inhuman
judgment, and my second shirt&mdash;my first is in rags&mdash;is
stripped from my body to glut the avarice of my
relentless pursuers. Thank God, I have at last found
a friend in that distinguished man who has been so
ruthlessly, so recently assailed, by that fledgling of the
aristocracy, Augustus Postlethwaite Tompkinson. Yes,
sir, in the Hon. Middleton Flam I have found a friend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
He has given me letters to this benevolent gentleman,
Mr. Handy; he has recommended my establishment
here; he promises to co-operate with this respectable
club in giving me a foothold among you. With her
Flams and her Handys, Quodlibet is destined to an
enviable influence in this great Republic." (Here he
was interrupted by loud cheers.) "My scheme is, Mr.
President, with the aid of this club, and that of the
benefactors I have named, forthwith to start <span class="smcap">The
Quodlibet Whole Hog</span>. It shall take a decided and
uncompromising stand against <span class="smcap">The Thorough Blue
Whole Team</span>, (here he was again arrested by cheers;)
pledged to contradict every word uttered by that vile
print, (cheers;) to traduce and bring down its editor by
the most systematic disparagement, (cheers;) to disprove
all Whig assertions; unfailingly to take the
opposite side on all questions; industriously to lower
the standing of the members of the Whig party, (immense
cheers;) through thick and thin, good report
and evil report, for better and for worse, to defend
and sustain the administration of the new President,
who is about to take his seat, that incomparable Democrat
of the genuine Quodlibetarian stamp, Martin Van
Buren, (at this point the cheering continued for some
moments, with such violence that the speaker had to
suspend his remarks;) and finally, sir, to commend,
exalt, and illustrate the character and pretensions of our
unrivaled friend Mr. Flam, (immense cheering,) giving
utterance to his sentiments, preponderance to his
opinions, authority to his advice on all proper and
suitable occasions, (loud cheering for a long time.) In
short, sir, The Whole Hog shall be what its name im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>ports,
a faithful mirror of the Democracy of Quodlibet.
Its publication shall be weekly; its size, twenty-six
by twenty, having the advantage over the Whole
Team by full two inches each way. There, sir, is an
outline of my sentiments and proposed paper." Mr.
Fox concluded this address in the midst of a congratulatory
uproar, altogether unprecedented in the
club.</p>

<p>Seizing upon the enthusiasm of the moment, and
being rather fearful that Fog would attempt to make
a speech, which that gentleman's condition would have
rendered extremely improper at this hour, Mr. Handy
immediately offered a resolution for the establishment
of the Whole Hog, and its adoption as the organ of the
party, on the principles proposed by Mr. Fox. This
was carried by acclamation; and the members without
further discussion adjourned to the bar-room, where
Nim Porter offered a bet&mdash;and not finding any one to
take him up, continued to offer it during the evening&mdash;of
fifty dollars to twenty-five, or one hundred to fifty,
that Eliphalet Fox would run Augustus Postlethwaite
Tompkinson's Whole Team out of Quodlibet in six
months from that day:&mdash;that there would not be but
two copies of the Whole Team taken in the Borough,
and that one of them would be Michael Grant's out at
the Hogback:&mdash;"for," said Nim, with an oath, which
I will not repeat&mdash;"I can see it in that Liphlet Fox's
eye; if he isn't a gouger when his bile's fresh, there
aint nothing in Lavender on Physiology, or Fowler on
the Shape of Heads."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chapt-summary smaller">BEING A SHORT HISTORY OF ELIPHALET FOX.</p>

<p class="p2">Eliphalet Fox's paper, "The Whole Hog," made
its first appearance on the day of the inauguration of
President Van Buren. Bright were the omens that
heralded its birth. The lustrous orb of Jackson had
just set in an ocean of splendor. Happy old man!
Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas! In the
glowing language of his own immortal valedictory, he
left "this great people prosperous and happy." That
star of the second magnitude, Martin Van Buren, first
among the sidera minora, had just risen. In the nearly
equally immortal salutatory of this Sidus Minor, he
spake the words, "we present an aggregate of human
prosperity surely not elsewhere to be found." Fortunate
omens, incomparable auspices! Under these
cheering signs "The Whole Hog" appeared upon the
stage.</p>

<p>Never was paper more faithful to the Quodlibetarian
theory. Never was editor more richly endowed to sustain
that theory than Eliphalet Fox. My reader will
doubtless expect that I should impart such gleanings
of the editor's life as my diligent researches have
enabled me to collect. This reasonable expectation
shall be indulged.</p>

<p>Eliphalet Fox was one of those men whose career<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
furnishes so remarkable a commentary upon the beneficent
character of our great Democratic Quodlibetarian
principle. His ancestors, two generations back, were
Federal and rich: in the last generation they were
Federal and poor&mdash;a transition strikingly natural and
eminently illustrative of our free institutions. Eliphalet
was born in the town of Gabwrangle, in the adjoining
State. His education was circumscribed to the circle
of reading, writing, and arithmetic, which Eliphalet
himself sometimes jocosely describes as algebraically
denoted by the signs of the three Rs; to wit, Reading,
Righting, and Rithmetic&mdash;a joke (mehercule) both ingenious
and new!</p>

<p>His parents being, as I may say, inops pecuni,
bound Eliphalet to a trade; but handicraft was abhorrent
to his genius. His temper was sour and
peevish; and though seemingly meek, even to a degree
of asininity, in his demeanor, yet it was early discovered
that, upon occasion, he could very deftly and
nimbly, as the poet says, "unpack his heart with words
and fall to swearing like a very drab." This art was
too valuable in Eliphalet's time to go long without a
patron; and, accordingly, after he had worked four
most reluctant years in a printing-office, to which his
respectable parents, thwarting the current of his genius,
had devoted him, he was discovered and taken by the
hand by Mr. Theophilus Flam, brother of the late
Judge, and leader of the Federal party of Gabwrangle.
It was just before the war; and the party being hard
set upon by its enemies, had, like a cat surrounded
by curs, thrown itself upon its back, and essayed to
defend itself, most cattishly, with claw and tooth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
And sharply, as we well know, did they fight. Eliphalet,
in this strife, played the part of a claw, showing
most admirable spring nails, though ordinarily hid, and
therefore but little suspected in his velvet paw. His
position in this battle was that of conductor of "The
Gabwrangle Grimalkin," a cross-grained, querulous,
tart and vinegarish little folio, which hoisted the banner
of Theophilus Flam, and swore in his words.
Eliphalet Fox, in consequence of the trusty position
which was thus confided to him, and still more by
reason of a certain rabid but laudable hatred of all
who bore the name of Democrat, in those days, (and
here I would have my reader mark that a Democrat
of 1812 was a very different thing from a Democrat
of this our day, especially from a true Quodlibetarian
Democrat,) rose to be a person of great consideration
in Gabwrangle. The party of Theophilus Flam, like
our illustrious chief of the new Democracy, Mr. Van
Buren, made sturdy opposition to Madison and his
unrighteous war, and finally enjoyed the satisfaction
of a complete triumph over all their political adversaries
in Gabwrangle, by an utter route of the spurious
Democrats who opposed them: a point of good fortune
which did not fall to the lot of our illustrious chief at
Kinderhook; since history records the disastrous fact
that he, so far from conquering, was obliged to give in,
and was even unhappily compelled, by the force of adverse
winds, to go over to the majority, (an event very
distressing to his feelings,) when he found that that
majority was so obstinate as to refuse to come on his
side: he was, if I may so say, as it were, a prisoner-of-war,
and acted under a vis major. But at Gab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>wrangle&mdash;thanks
to the persevering tongue and pen
of Eliphalet Fox!&mdash;it was all the other way; and "The
Grimalkin," to the last, enjoyed a most enviable renown
as the bitterest reviler of Mr. Madison and his
doings.</p>

<p>Habit grows into an instinct, and as times change
our habits are the last to follow the fashion. It is only
by referring to this deep-seated principle of human
nature, that I am able to account for the extraordinary
vituperation which Eliphalet Fox, at a later day, poured
upon the head of the Old Hero when he was brought
out for President. The Grimalkin, like all poison-concocting
animals, grew more venomous as it grew older;
and were it not that Eliphalet has repented of this
folly, and amply atoned for its commission, I should
blush to record the almost savage ferocity, the altogether
unpardonable acerbity, and, above all, the thoroughly
unquodlibetarian freedom with which he assailed
the purest man that in the tide of time&mdash;as
another pure man has remarked&mdash;ever appeared upon
this terraqueous globe. But the truth is, Eliphalet
had fallen into <i>a habit</i> of detraction, and did it without
thinking:&mdash;that is the best excuse that can be
made for him. The old Federalists of Gabwrangle,
and, foremost among them, his master, Theophilus
Flam, soon corrected this unhappy proclivity, and
gave him to understand that he was on a wrong scent.
They peremptorily, to their great honor, insisted that
from that day forth the Grimalkin must be decent.
The consequence of this was fatal to Eliphalet Fox&mdash;fatal
at least to his prosperity in Gabwrangle. Thenceforth
the Grimalkin sunk into insignificance. As the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
poet says, Othello's occupation was gone. The subscribers
grew testy and dropped off, under the influence
of this uncongenial decency exacted from the
editor. Eliphalet borrowed money, his habiliments
grew shabby, he took up mean callings for the sake of
pelf, he became a spunge; he grew bilious, atrabilious,
patriotic and indignant. He went for <span class="smcap">Reform</span>&mdash;reform
of the General Government, reform of the State
Constitution, reform of private manners, reform of
public observances. He took up an aversion to all
kinds of respectability, became a deadly enemy to
every man who laid up any money&mdash;made this sentiment
a political question, talked of a division of property,
called Nature a stepmother, said sundry hard
things about the persecution of genius, and finally, one
Sunday night, eloped from Gabwrangle, leaving his
fiscal responsibilities in a state of as much perplexity
as that into which these vile Whigs have brought those
of the government. Alas, for Eliphalet! little did he
dream that out of this desolation and dismay he was to
pluck so bright a flower of prosperity as he now wears
in his bosom. All the hounds of the law&mdash;as he so
eloquently painted it to the New Light at our celebrated
meeting&mdash;were set upon his track; but grace to
his better destiny! he eluded them. To twenty writs
placed on Monday morning in the sheriff's hands, that
functionary made his return on Tuesday evening,
"Eloped under whip and spur out of the bailiwick."&mdash;Oh,
lucky Eliphalet!</p>

<p>In these straits the badgered patriot went to Washington;
was recognized by our distinguished representative,
who, knowing that we were in want of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
editor fit to cope with The Whole Team, gave him a
warm letter of recommendation to Nicodemus Handy,
and forthwith was projected that famous movement,
whereof I have already given the history, and which
has so auspiciously resulted in the establishment of The
Quodlibet Whole Hog.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

with all their troop of plethoric and pampered paragon
sister banks, one and all, without one pang of remorse,
without one word of warning, without even, as
far as we could see, one tingle of a suppressed and
struggling blush, incontinently suspended specie payments!!
O curas hominum! Quantum est in rebus
inane!</p>

<p>Shall I tell it? Even the Patriotic Copperplate Bank
of Quodlibet was compelled to follow in this faithless
path. Not at once, I confess&mdash;not off-hand, and with
such malice prepense as the others&mdash;for Nicodemus
Handy had a soul above such black ingratitude&mdash;but
after a pause, and, let the truth be told in extenuation,
because he could not help it.</p>

<p>The Hon. Middleton Flam was sent for upon the
first tidings of this extraordinary kicking in the traces
by these high-mettled institutions&mdash;tidings which
reached Quodlibet, via the canal, about eleven o'clock
one morning in May. The Directors were summoned
into council. What was to be done? was the general
question. Anthony Hardbottle, of the firm of Barndollar
&amp; Hardbottle&mdash;a grave man and a thoughtful; a
man without flash, who seldom smiles&mdash;a lean man,
hard favored and simple in his outgoings and incomings;
a man, who has never sported, as long as I have
known him, any other coat than that snuff-brown with
covered buttons, and who does not wear out above one
pair of shoes in a year; a man who could never be
persuaded to give so far into the times as to put on a
black cravat, but has always stuck to the white:&mdash;such
a man, it may be easily imagined, was not to be carried
away by new-fangled notions:&mdash;he was there at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Board, in place of Theodore Fog, who was compelled
two years before to withdraw his name as a candidate
for re-election. This same Anthony Hardbottle, speaking
under the dictates of that cautious wisdom natural
to him as a merchant, answered this question of What
was to be done?&mdash;by another equally laconic and pregnant
with meaning&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"How much cash have we on hand?"</p>

<p>"One hundred and seven dollars and thirty-seven
and a half cents in silver," replied Nicodemus, "and
five half eagles in gold, which were brought here
by our honorable President and placed on deposit,
after he had used them in the last election for the purpose
of showing the people what an admirable currency
we were to have, as soon as Mr. Benton should succeed
in making it float up the stream of the Mississippi."</p>

<p>Again asked Anthony Hardbottle, "What circulation
have you abroad?"</p>

<p>"Six hundred thousand dollars," replied Nicodemus,
"and a trifle over."</p>

<p>"Then," said Anthony, "I think we had better
suspend with the rest."</p>

<p>"Never," said the Hon. Middleton Flam, rising
from his seat and thumping the table violently with
his hand. "Never, sir, while I am President of this
bank, and there is a shot in the locker."</p>

<p>"Bravo&mdash;well said, admirably said, spoke as a
Quodlibetarian ought to speak!" shouted Dr. Thomas
G. Winkleman, the keeper of the soda-water Pavilion;
"I have fifteen dollars in five-penny bits; they are at
the service of the Board, and while I hold a piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
coin, the Patriotic Copperplate Bank shall never be
subjected to the reproach of being unable to meet its
obligations. Anthony Hardbottle, as a Democrat I
am surprised at you."</p>

<p>"I can't help it," replied Anthony; "in my opinion,
our issues are larger than our means."</p>

<p>"How larger, sir?" demanded Mr. Snuffers, the
President of the New Light, with some asperity of
tone.&mdash;"Haven't we a batch of bran-new notes, just
signed and ready for delivery? Redeem the old ones
with new. Why should we suspend?"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I will put the question to the Board,"
interposed Mr. Flam, fearful lest a quarrel might arise,
if the debate continued. "Shall this bank suspend
specie payments? Those in favor of this iniquitous
proposition will say <span class="smcap">Ay</span>."</p>

<p>No one answered. Anthony Hardbottle was intimidated
by the President's stern manner.</p>

<p>"Those opposed to it will say <span class="smcap">No</span>."</p>

<p>"No!" was the universal acclamation of the Board,
with the exception of Anthony Hardbottle who did
not open his lips.</p>

<p>"Thank you, gentlemen," said Mr. Flam, "for this
generous support. I should have been compelled by
the adoption of this proposition, much as I esteem this
Board, much as I value your good opinion, to have
returned the commission with which you have honored
me as your President. Our country first, and then
ourselves! The Democracy of Quodlibet never will
suspend!"</p>

<p>At this moment confused noises were heard in the
banking-room, which adjoined that in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Directors were convened. Mr. Handy immediately
sprang from his chair and went into this apartment.</p>

<p>There stood about thirty persons, principally boatmen
from the canal. At their head, some paces
advanced into the bank, was Flanigan Sucker. One
sleeve of Flan's coat was torn open from the shoulder
to the wrist; his shirt, of a very indefinite complexion,
was open at the breast, disclosing the shaggy mat of
hair that adorned this part of his person; his corduroy
trowsers had but one suspender to keep them up, thus
giving them rather a lop-sided set. His face was fiery-red;
and his hat, which was considerably frayed at
the brim, was drawn over one ear, and left uncovered
a large portion of his forehead and crown which were
embellished by wild elf locks of carroty hue.</p>

<p>"Nicodemus," said Flan. as soon as the Cashier
made his appearance, "we have come to make a run
upon the bank:&mdash;they say you've bursted your biler."
Then turning to the crowd behind him, he shouted,
"Growl, Tigers!&mdash;Yip! yip! Hurra!"</p>

<p>As Flan. yelled out these words, a strange muttering
sound broke forth from the multitude.</p>

<p>"What put into your drunken noddle that we have
broke?" inquired Mr. Handy, with great composure,
as soon as silence was restored.</p>

<p>"Nim Porter ses, Nicodemus, that you're a gone
horse, and that if you ain't busted up, you will be before
night. So we have determined on a run."</p>

<p>Nim Porter, who was standing in the rear of the
crowd, where he had come to see how matters were
going on, now stepped forward. Nim is the fattest
man in Quodlibet, and besides, is the most dressy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
good-natured man we have. On this occasion there he
stood with a stiff starched linen roundabout jacket on,
as white as the driven snow, with white drilling pantaloons
just from the washerwoman, and the most
strutting ruffle to his shirt that could have been manufactured
out of cambric. In all points he was unlike
the crowd of persons who occupied the room. "I said
nothing of the sort&mdash;" was Nim's reply&mdash;"and I am
willing now to bet ten to one that he can't produce a
man here to say I said so."</p>

<p>"What's the odds!" cried Flan; "Nicodemus, we
are resolved upon a run&mdash;so shell out!"</p>

<p>"Begin when it suits you," said Mr. Handy. "Let
me have your note, and I will give you either silver or
gold as you choose."</p>

<p>"You don't catch me that way," shouted Flan., with
a drunken grimace. "Notes is not in my line&mdash;shell
out anyhow. We have determined on a run&mdash;a genuine,
dimmycratic sortie."</p>

<p>"Have you none of our paper?" again inquired Mr.
Handy.</p>

<p>"Not a shaving, Nicodemus," replied Flan. "What's
the odds?"</p>

<p>"But I have," said a big, squinting boatman, as he
walked up to our Cashier, and untied his leather wallet.
"There's sixty dollars, and I'll thank you for the
cash.</p>

<p>"And I have twenty-five more," cried out another.</p>

<p>"And I twice twenty-five," said a gruff voice from
the midst of the crowd.</p>

<p>All this time the number of persons outside was
increasing, and very profane swearing was heard about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the door. Mr. Handy stepped to the window to get a
view of the assemblage, and seeing that nearly all the
movable part of Quodlibet was gathering in front of
the building, he retired with some trepidation into the
Directors' room, and informed Mr. Flam and the Board
of what was going on. They had a pretty good suspicion
of this before Mr. Handy returned, for they had
distinctly heard the uproar. Mr. Handy no sooner
communicated the fact to them, than Mr. Flam, with
considerable perturbation in his looks, rose and declared
that Quodlibet was in a state of insurrection; and, as
every one must be aware, that in the midst of a revolution
no bank could be expected to pay specie, he
moved, in consideration of this menacing state of
affairs, that the Patriotic Copperplate Bank of Quodlibet
suspend specie payments forthwith, and continue
the same until such time as the re-establishment of the
public peace should authorize a resumption. This motion
was gratefully received by the Board, and carried
without a division. During this interval, the conspirators
having learned, through their leader, Flan.
Sucker, that the Hon. Middleton Flam was in the
house, forthwith set up a violent shouting for that distinguished
gentleman to appear at the door. It was
some moments before our representative was willing to
obey this summons: the Board of Directors were thrown
into a panic, and with great expedition got out of the
back window into the yard, and made their escape&mdash;thus
leaving the indomitable and unflinching President
of the bank, a man of lion heart, alone in the apartment;
while the yells and shouts of the multitude were
ringing in his ears with awful reduplication. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
not at a loss to perform his duty, but, with a dignified
and stately movement, stalked into the banking-room,
approached the window that looked upon the street,
threw it open, and gave himself in full view to the
multitude.</p>

<p>There was a dreadful pause; a scowl sat upon every
brow; a muttering silence prevailed. As Tacitus says:
"Non tumultus, non quies, sed quale magni metus, et
magn ir silentium est." Mr. Flam raised his arm,
and spoke in this strain:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Men of Quodlibet, what madness has seized upon
you? Do you assemble in front of this edifice to make
the day hideous with howling? Is it to insult Nicodemus
Handy, a worthy New Light, or is it to affright
the universe by pulling down these walls? Shame on
you, men of Quodlibet! If you have a vengeance to
wreak, do not inflict it upon us. Go to the Whigs, the
authors of our misfortune. They have brought these
things upon us. Year after year have we been struggling
to give you a constitutional currency&mdash;the real
Jackson gold&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Three cheers for Middleton Flam!" cried out
twenty voices, and straightway the cheers ascended on
the air; and in the midst was heard a well-known
voice, "Yip! yip!&mdash;Go it, Middleton!"</p>

<p>"Yes, my friends," proceeded the orator, "while
we have been laboring to give you the solid metals;
while we have been fighting against this <span class="smcap lowercase">PAPER-MONEY
PARTY</span>, and have devoted all our energies to the endeavor
to prostrate the influence of these <span class="smcap lowercase">RAG BARONS</span>,
these <span class="smcap lowercase">MONOPOLISTS</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">THESE CHAMPIONS OF VESTED RIGHTS
AND CHARTERED PRIVILEGES</span>, the <span class="smcap">Whigs</span>&mdash;we have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
foiled at every turn by the power of their unholy combinations
of associated wealth. They have filled your
land with banks, and have brought upon us all the
curses of <i>over-trading</i> and <i>over-speculating</i>, until the
people are literally on their faces at the footstool of
the Money Power. (Tremendous cheering.) Our course
has been resolute and unwaveringly patriotic. We have
stood in the breach and met the storm; but all without
avail. Between the rich and the poor lies a mighty
gulf. The rich man <i>has</i>, the poor man <i>wants</i>. Of
that which the rich hath, does he give to the poor?
Answer me, men of Quodlibet."</p>

<p>"No!" arose, deep-toned, from every throat.</p>

<p>"Then our course is plain. Poor men, one and all,
rally round our Democratic banner. Let the aristocrats
know and feel that you will not bear this tyranny."</p>

<p>"We will," shouted Flan. Sucker. "Go it, Middleton!"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," continued Mr. Flam, "this bank of
ours is purely <span class="smcap">Democratic</span>. It is an exception to all
other banks; it is emphatically the poor man's friend:
nothing can exceed the skill and caution with which it
has been conducted. Would that all other banks were
like it! We have, comparatively, but a small issue of
paper afloat; we have a large supply of specie. You
perceive, therefore, that we fear no run. You all saw
with what alacrity our Cashier proffered to redeem
whatever amount our respectable fellow-citizen, that
excellent Democrat, Mr. Flanigan Sucker, might demand.
(Cheers, and a cry of 'Yip!') Mr. Sucker was
satisfied, and did not desire to burden himself with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
specie. Gentlemen, depend upon <i>me</i>. When there is
danger, if such a thing could be to this New-Light
Democratic bank, I will be the first to give you warning.
(Cheers, and 'Hurrah for Flam.') Born with an
instinctive love of the people, I should be the vilest of
men, if I could ever forget my duty to them. (Immense
cheering, and cries of 'Flam forever!') Take
my advice, retire to your homes, keep an eye on the
Whigs and their wicked schemes to bolster up the
State banks, make no run upon this institution&mdash;it is
an ill bird that defiles its own nest&mdash;and, before you
depart, gentlemen, let me inform you that, having the
greatest regard to your interest, we have determined
upon a temporary suspension, as a mere matter of
caution against the intrigues of the Whigs, who, we
have every reason to believe, actuated by their implacable
hatred of the New-Light Democracy, will
assail this, your favorite bank, with a malevolence
unexampled in all their past career. (Loud cheers, and
cries of 'Stand by the bank.') But, Quodlibetarians,
rally, and present a phalanx more terrible than the
Macedonian to the invader. You can&mdash;I am sure
you will&mdash;and, therefore, I tell you your bank is
safe."</p>

<p>"We can, we will!" rose from the whole multitude,
accompanied with cheers that might vie with the bursting
of the ocean surge.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," added Mr. Flam, "I thank you for
the manifestation of this patriotic sentiment. It is no
more than I expected of Quodlibet. In conclusion, I
am requested, my good friends, by Mr. Handy, to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
that having just prepared some notes on a <i>superior</i>
paper, he will redeem at the counter any old ones you
may chance to hold, in that new emission; and I can
with pride assure you, that this late supply is equal,
perhaps, to anything that has ever been issued in the
United States. With my best wishes, gentlemen, for
your permanent prosperity, under the new and glorious
dynasty of that distinguished New-Light Democrat,
whom the unbought suffrages of millions of freemen
have called to the supreme executive chair, (cheers,)
and under whose lead we fondly indulge the hope of
speedily sweeping from existence this pestilential brood
of Whig banks, I respectfully take my leave."</p>

<p>Having concluded this masterly appeal to the reason
and good sense of the people, Mr. Flam withdrew
under nine distinct rounds of applause.</p>

<p>The effect of this powerful speech, which has often
since been compared to that of Cicero against Catiline,
was completely to still the public mind of Quodlibet,
and also to remove all apprehensions of the solidity of
our bank. But its happiest feature was the vindication
of the bank against that charge of treachery and ingratitude
which so justly lies at the door of all the
other banks of the country. The Patriotic Copperplate
Bank of Quodlibet was, as Mr. Flam observed,
<i>purely Democratic</i>&mdash;Democratic in its origin, in its
principles, in its organization, in its management, in
its officers, its stockholders, and its customers. Such
a bank, of course, could not be unfaithful to the Democratic
administration that fostered it&mdash;<i>infidelity or
ingratitude to party is no inhabitant of a Democratic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
bosom</i>. If there be men upon earth who go all lengths,
through thick and thin, for party, it is (I say it with
pride) the genuine New-Light Quodlibetarian Democracy.
Our bank, therefore, stands uncontaminated
by that revolting perfidy which, at the instigation of
Biddle and the Barings, brought all the other banks,
in which there are Whig directors or officers, into the
most wicked conspiracy recorded in history.</p>

<p>It was not long after this astounding event before
the opinions uttered above were fully and most remarkably
confirmed by a letter from the Hermitage; a
letter which for its shrewdness of view, its perspicacity,
its lucid style and Hero-and-Sage-like felicity of construction,
is unequaled in the productions of the venerable
Chief. I am happy to insert it here, as a most
eloquent exposition of the causes of the suspension&mdash;feeling
assured that its distinguished author had no
reference to the Democratic banks, and especially none
to ours of Quodlibet, but intended it entirely for the
vile Whigs.</p>

<p>"<i>The history of the world</i>," says this immortal man,
writing July ninth, to the virgin-minded, tremulously-sensitive,
and unrewarded editor of the Globe, "<i>never
has recorded such base treachery and perfidy as has
been committed by the deposit banks against the government,
and purely with a view of gratifying Biddle and
the Barings, and by the suspension of specie payments,
degrade, embarrass, and ruin, if they could, their own
country, for the selfish views of making large profits
by throwing out millions of depreciated paper upon
the people&mdash;selling their specie at large premiums, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
buying up their own paper at discounts of from 25 to
50 per cent., and now looking forward to be indulged
in these speculations for years to come before they resume
specie payments.</i>"</p>

to lead thine Israelites beyond Jordan! Happy
do I, S. S., Schoolmaster of Quodlibet, account myself
that I have lived in this thy day!</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p class="chapt-summary smaller">SIGNS OF DISCORD IN QUODLIBET&mdash;THE IRON-RAILING CONTROVERSY&mdash;AGAMEMNON
FLAG'S NOMINATION&mdash;REVOLT OF THEODORE FOG&mdash;THE
CELEBRATED SPLIT&mdash;CONSEQUENCES OF JESSE FERRET'S PERNICIOUS
DOGMA IN REFERENCE TO PUBLICANS&mdash;FIRST FRUITS OF
THE SPLIT MANIFESTED AT MRS. FERRET'S TEA DRINKING&mdash;GRAVE
REFLECTIONS BY THE AUTHOR&mdash;MORAL.</p>

<p class="p2">The exciting summer of 1837, with the special
election of a member of Congress for the extra session&mdash;to
which we returned our long-tried and faithful
representative, Mr. Middleton Flam, almost without
opposition&mdash;went by. All eyes were turned upon the
proceedings of Congress at that extra sitting; and a
great many speculations were afloat in Quodlibet,
where, I am pained to disclose the fact, very serious
contrariety of opinion began to spring up in reference
to the Sub-Treasury. Our State election, for members
of the Legislature, was to come on in October, and a
convention, called for the purpose, had nominated
Agamemnon Flag, at the head of the ticket, with
Abram Schoolcraft, the nursery man in Bickerbray,
and Curtius Short, Cheap store-keeper in Tumbledown,
as the Regular New-Light Democratic Quodlibetarian
candidates. Unhappily this nomination
gave dissatisfaction to numbers of our friends. Agamemnon
Flag, who was the only stump man on the
ticket, (Schoolcraft and Short having expressly stipu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>lated
that they were not to be called on to speak in the
canvass,) was a young member of the bar, comparatively
a stranger to many in the Borough, (having within the
last year removed from Bickerbray,) and, laboring
under the infirmity of short-sightedness, wore a delicate
pair of gold spectacles. I have observed that short-sighted
persons in general are not apt to be popular
in a Democratic government.</p>

<p>But there was another matter that operated against
Agamemnon. Quodlibet had been made the county-seat
of justice by an act of the last Legislature, and
we were just finishing a court-house which, in anticipation
of this event, we had commenced a year before.
A question arose among the townspeople, whether
the court-house square should be surrounded by a
wooden or by an iron railing. This question created
great agitation. Several Whigs of the Borough made
themselves active in the debate, and went for the iron.
The New-Light Quods were strong for wood. Agamemnon
Flag, seeing that a great deal of ill blood was
getting up between the parties, made a speech to a
town meeting on this subject, and went in for a compromise&mdash;he
was for wood on the <i>two sides</i> and <i>back</i>
of the square, and iron <i>in front</i>. This proposition he
advocated with great earnestness and ability, and finally
carried his point by a close vote. The wooden party
said that the vote was not a fair one, and that they
could not regard it as a legitimate expression of the
popular voice, because it was taken just as a shower of
rain was coming up, when many persons present who
had come without umbrellas had given no heed to the
question, and voted as it were in the dark. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the vote was not recalled, and the iron railing is now
in a course of fabrication over at the Hogback Forge,
which happens unluckily to be owned by Stephen P.
Crabstock, one of the most bull-headed Whigs in this
county, the job being given by the commissioners to
him in consequence of there being no genuine New-Light
Democratic iron works in this part of the
county.</p>

<p>When Agamemnon Flag was brought out at the
head of the ticket for the Legislature, nothing was said
about the iron railing, and we had good reason to suppose
that every true Quod would support the nomination;
which in fact was made by the direction of our
honorable representative in Congress, who had a great
liking for Flag in consequence of a very beautifully
written memoir of Mr. Flam, which appeared two years
ago in the Bickerbray Scrutinizer, when Flag lived in
that town. In point of principle, Agamemnon was
altogether unexceptionable. He was an out-and-out
Flamite of the first water, and an unadulterated Quodlibetarian
in every sentiment.</p>

<p>Theodore Fog&mdash;I regret to be obliged to mention
his name in any terms of disparagement, because he is
unquestionably a man of talents and a true-bred New
Light, and certainly we owe Theodore a good deal&mdash;had
been very sour for some time past. He had never
forgotten the making of Middleton Flam President of
the bank. I have in a former chapter hinted somewhat
of Theodore's unfortunate habits. Dolet mihi,&mdash;I grieve
to repeat these things. But the truth must be told.
His diurnal aberrations became at length so conspicuous
that, after being twice elected a Director of the bank,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
his name was struck off the ticket and Anthony Hardbottle's
substituted in his place. Theodore never had
much practice at the bar, although he considers himself
the founder of that fraternity at Quodlibet, being
for a season the only lawyer in the Borough. That
little practice had now pretty nearly left him; in consequence
of which he thought himself badly used, and
therefore entitled to a support from the public. These
feelings operating upon his mind, induced him, soon
after the nomination of Agamemnon Flag, to come out
in opposition and declare himself an Independent
Candidate.</p>

<p>The Whigs, taking advantage of this split in the
party, brought out Andy Grant, son of old Michael of
the Hogback; a young man of fair character, but
wholly and fatally imbued with those dangerous opinions
which have already brought so many misfortunes
upon our country.</p>

<p>This was the state of things at the commencement
of the month of September; and it will be seen in the
sequel that very serious difficulties grew out of this
division.</p>

<p>A meeting of the voters of the county, which included
the three towns of Quodlibet, Tumbledown, and Bickerbray,
was called at the Sycamore Spring, upon the
Rumblebottom, about five miles below Quodlibet. This
meeting was to be held on the eighth. A reference to
these events is necessary to explain the scene which I
am about to present to my reader.</p>

<p>Jesse Ferret, as my reader knows, had brought himself
into some scandal by his indefinite political sentiments,
and that most unquodlibetarian dogma that "a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Publican should have no side." Now, Mrs. Ferret and
her daughter, Susan Barndollar, were just antipodes to
Jesse. Two truer women, more firm-set in the New-Light
Democracy, more constant in opinion, whether
in the utterance thereof or in its quality, and better
able to hold their own, have I never chanced to meet,
than this respectable mother and daughter. It is
common to say women are not allowed a voice in our
government. My faith! these two ladies had a voice
in Quodlibet, allowed or not allowed&mdash;let the theory go
as it may:&mdash;and Jesse Ferret knows that full well.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ferret is what we call a fleshy or lusty woman:
she weighed two hundred and twelve, in Neal Hopper's
new one-sided patent scale at the mill. She is amazingly
well padded with fat across the shoulders, and
has a craw-shaped bosom that in some degree encroaches
upon her neck; and she is famous for wearing
a large frilled and quilled cap with many blue ribbons,
being a little given to finery. Although Susan Barndollar
was grown up and married, Mrs. Ferret had a
child in the arms at that time; and Jesse has even
boasted, within the last five years, of running two
cradles at one time.</p>

<p>It was on the evening of the seventh of September,
the night before the meeting at the Sycamore Spring,
when Mrs. Ferret had a tea drinking in the back
parlor, at which I, the only one of the masculine, was
present as a guest. Mrs. Younghusband was of the party,
and Mrs. Snuffers, with her interesting fat female infant
nine months old; the same dear child whose arrangements
to appear in this world of cares procured me the
honor of presiding over the New Light, on the memor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>able
occasion of Mr. Flam's great speech at Christmas,
whereof I have spoken in a former chapter: thanks to
Mrs. Snuffers for that considerate favor! This good
lady was there; and these two, with the addition of
Miss Hardbottle, elder sister of Barndollar &amp; Hardbottle,
and Mrs. Susan Barndollar, who lived at home
with her mother, made up the company.</p>

<p>"There is one thing," said Mrs. Ferret, as she
rocked herself in a huge hickory arm-chair, which had
been built on purpose for her, "that I <i>do</i> hold in
despise; and that is, one of these here men who haint
got no opinions. Ef you believe me, Mrs. Snuffers,
that man Jesse Ferret&mdash;this woman's father, (pointing
to Mrs. Barndollar,) God forgive me that I should say
anythink aginst my datur's own lawful flesh and blood!&mdash;but
he's actelly afeard to go down to-morrow to the
Sycamore Spring to hear the tongue-lashing which
Theodore Fog, which is a man I always respected&mdash;they
say he drinks, but there's many a man which
don't drink, hasn't half his brains&mdash;Jesse's actelly
afeard to go and hear how Theodore will use up Ag
Flag and Andy Grant both at the same time, least
they might be for making him take sides, which he
hasn't the spunk to do. My patience! but it would be
nuts to me to hear the speechification!&mdash;and, to think
of it&mdash;that man hasn't the heart of a goose to go to
the meeting!"</p>

<p>"Ah, Mrs. Ferret," said Mrs. Snuffers, talking as
if she had a cold in the head, her voice being husky,
in fact, from having taken a large pinch of snuff,
"them politicks&mdash;them politicks! Poor Mr. Snuffers!&mdash;dear
man: I 'spose you know he is President of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
New Light; he's losing his naiteral rest upon account
of that split. He put in his wote in the conwention
for Ag, as innocent as a lamb, and here comes up that
obstropolus iron railing, and smashes all the New
Lights into outer darkness, with diwisions and contentions
and all sorts of infractions. Mr. Snuffers says
he shouldn't wonder if that unfortnate step should
take the Hay Scales from him and leave me and this
here innocent darlin' babe in a state of destitution.
Oh them politicks!"</p>

<p>"Well, let people stand by their colors, says I,"
interposed Mrs. Barndollar, tartly, with a sharp shake
of her head; "I go with my ma, although pa is pa. I
think people ought to speak what they please, and
mean what they please; and it's a mean thing not to
do so, and that's gospel truth, or else this is not a free
country. Ma is right; and if Mr. Snuffers is what
Mr. Barndollar calls a Whole Hog, he'll not mind the
people a jot, but go with his party; that's the law.
And I don't agree by no means with ma, in going for
Theodore against the nomination."</p>

<p>"Susan Barndollar, are you in earnest?" inquired
her affectionate ma. "Who put it into your head to
underrate and strangle down Theodore Fog, the oldest
friend we have had sence we came to Quodlibet? and
who brings more custom to our bar than the whole
New-Light Club put together. Susan, Susan, I hope
Jacob hain't been putting none of these ungrateful
ideers into your breast. Ef this house of ours, commonly
called and known by the name of The Hero,
ought to go for any human, mortal, individual man,
that man is Theodore Fog. Ef he is a little exintric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
in regard of his drinking, it won't be no new think in
the Legislater, ef the tenth part of what I heerd is true.
Ladies&mdash;tea," said the dame, as at this time a negro
woman entered with a tray filled with great store of
provender&mdash;"help yourself, Mrs. Younghusband&mdash;take
a plate on your knee, and fork up one of them warfields&mdash;and
take care of your gown, they're a dripping
with butter. Mr. Secondthoughts, what under heaven
has become of your perliteness that you can see Mrs.
Younghusband a fishing up that briled dried beef without
her fork no more sticking in it than if it was a live
eel in the gravy!"</p>

<p>"Never mind me, Mrs. Ferret," replied Mrs. Younghusband,
"and don't be a troublin' the schoolmaster on
my account. They do say that there's some persons
as hard to catch and pin down as hung beef crisped
and floating in butter, and as you justly remarked, a
while ago, one of these persons is not a hundred miles
off from this house:" and here this good woman
laughed heartily at her own joke.</p>

<p>"Oh Jesse Ferret, in course!" exclaimed the landlady.</p>

<p>"My pa!" said Mrs. Barndollar, joining in the laugh.</p>

<p>"As Mr. Ferret hasn't got many friends here," said
Miss Hardbottle, "I'll be one. I think he is quite
right, if he has no opinions, not to express them.
Don't you think so, Mr. Secondthoughts?"</p>

<p>"Madam," said I in a very grave manner, "if I
might be allowed to express myself freely, I would
venture to remark, that it is very important to the
ascendency of the New-Light Quodlibetarian Democratic
party, that there should be no strife nor division<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
in our ranks; and that, feeling the importance of this
sentiment, it is one of our fundamental principles to go
with the majority&mdash;whenever it can be ascertained.
Now between Agamemnon Flag and Theodore Fog&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Theodore Fog is sich a <i>good</i> creature!" interrupted
Mrs. Ferret.</p>

<p>"Ag is a <i>dear</i> young man," said Mrs. Barndollar.</p>

<p>"As for that, ladies," said Miss Hardbottle, "if you
speak of goodness or beauty, Andy Grant can beat
either, though he is a Whig."</p>

<p>"Hester Hardbottle!" shouted Mrs. Ferret.</p>

<p>"Hester Hardbottle!" shouted Mrs. Snuffers.</p>

<p>"Hester Hardbottle!" shouted Mrs. Younghusband.</p>

<p>"Hester Hardbottle!" shouted Mrs. Barndollar&mdash;all
four at once.</p>

<p>"I do think so," said Miss Hardbottle, sharply,
"and what I do think, I say."</p>

<p>"You have no right to say it, madam," said Mrs.
Barndollar.</p>

<p>"Free country," said Miss Hardbottle.</p>

<p>"No such a thing for Whigs," quickly returned Mrs.
Barndollar.</p>

<p>"Ladies! ladies! ladies!" said I, "peace, if you
please:" but there was no peace, for these excellent
females soon got into such a state of confusion in the
attack and defense of Andy Grant, that I believe the
tea-party would have broken up in a state of rebellion,
if it had not been for the entrance of Mr. Ferret in the
very height of the tumult. His appearance gave another
turn to the conversation, for it all turned upon him.</p>

<p>"And so you are not going to the Sycamore Spring
to-morrow," cried one.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I 'spose you won't vote for Theodore Fog,"
said Number Two.</p>

<p>"Nor for Ag Flag," said Number Three.</p>

<p>"But you will drop in a sly ticket for Andy Grant,
may be, at last, ef no one should find you out," said
Mrs. Ferret, who in this series counted Number Four.
"Oh Jesse Ferret, ef you had a drop of blood in you
that wasn't milk-and-water, you would be ashamed of
sich shilly-shally conduct, that even the women makes
you a laughing-stock!"</p>

<p>"Wife," said Jesse, taking a fierce stand in self-defense,
"drop it! If my blood was milk-and-water,
it would be curds-and-whey before this time. I tell
you again, old lady, a Publican's got no right to have
sentiments. The party's double splitted, and no man
knows which way to turn himself. There's that cursed
Iron Railing; and there's that infernal Suspension;
and there's the Divorce of the Government from bed
and board with the banks, that everybody's talking
about; and there's Purse and Sword, and Specie Circlar,
and Mint Drops, and the Lord knows what; that
a poor, sinful, infallible tavern keeper doesn't know
who's who, and what's what. I'm sure I can't tell
whether I'm on my head or my heels; and if I was to
go down yonder to the Sycamore Spring and hear all
the palavering there, I should get so flustrated I
wouldn't know which eend of me went foremost. So,
I tell you I'll stay at home and stick to my motto:&mdash;that's
as good as if I swore to it. Solomon Secondthoughts,
ain't I right?"</p>

<p>"Jesse," said I, mildly, "have you any respect for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
the opinion of our distinguished representative, my
former pupil, Middleton Flam?"</p>

<p>"Well, I voted for him," replied Jesse.</p>

<p>"Then," said I, "I admit there is a great perplexity
about all these public measures and men, just
at this time; and I am willing to allow that the New-Light
Democracy do not as yet exactly understand
their own minds; and therefore it is quite lawful to
pause and look about you before you take your stand.
This thing is certain, that the New-Light Democracy
will undoubtedly go with the government, whatever
line it chalks out for following the footsteps of its
illustrious predecessor. Whether that line shall lead
us North or South, East or West, my poor skill is not
able to instruct you. Whether we are <i>for</i> the banks
or <i>against</i> them, is yet undecided, since we are pledged
at least in favor of our own. In a Quodlibetarian
sense, I do not scruple to affirm that we are <i>against</i>
the banks and <i>for</i> the divorce; but in a private sense
that opinion will require some reflection. Mr. Flam
will be home from Congress before long, and until then
we shall suspend our opinion. We are, at all hazards,
real Flam men. Flam&mdash;I drop the mister when I
speak of him as a principle&mdash;is our polar star&mdash;our
cynosure in politics&mdash;our Pisgah, which gives us a view
of the Promised Land. As a principle, our New-Light
Democracy is all out-and-out Flam. Flam is our
father, our guide, our Pillar of Cloud. Wait till Middleton
Flam comes home."</p>

<p>Having thrown out these well-weighed and sententious
remarks, both for the women and for Jesse, I was
inwardly delighted to see how soothing was the effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
upon my auditory; and as it is a precept inculcated by
some sage observer of mankind, I forget his name, to
leave your company when you have made an agreeable
impression upon them, I did not tarry for further converse,
but took up my hat and stick, and bade my
worthy friends "good night."</p>

<p>Upon my return to my lodgings, I sat down and
made the foregoing narration of what had passed in
my presence, and I have incorporated the same into
this history, with no little mortification; feeling myself
compelled thereto by the consideration that the
scene I have described, being, as it were, the first
fruits of that unhappy dissension which grew up among
the New Lights, and a significant commentary thereon,
it may serve in the way of warning to all good Quodlibetarian
Democrats who may chance to peruse these
pages, against the folly of ever allowing themselves to
have any individual opinions, when the leaders and
marshals of the party shall have taken the trouble off
their hands of thinking and determining for them.
And, indeed, the moral may be carried further. For
it is obvious, if Jesse Ferret had acted in the spirit and
the intelligence of a true Quod, he would have ascertained
the majority and gone with it; instead of which,
he intrenched himself behind this fortress of neutrality,
comprehended in the absurd dogma that a Publican
ought to have no sides. Undoubtedly, the true precept
should be in all cases of public servants, "Take the
upper side." Thereon chiefly hangs the Quodlibetarian
theory.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p class="chapt-summary smaller">GREAT MEETING AT THE SYCAMORE SPRING&mdash;SOME DESCRIPTION OF
THE ARRANGEMENTS&mdash;NICODEMUS HANDY CHOSEN TO PRESIDE ON
THIS OCCASION&mdash;MOTION TO THAT EFFECT BY MR. SNUFFERS&mdash;THIS
WORTHY GENTLEMAN'S MISFORTUNE&mdash;HIS ESCAPE&mdash;SUCCESSFUL
ORGANIZATION OF THE MEETING.</p>

<p class="p2">The morning of the 8th of September, Anno Domini
1837, was cloudless and cool. The dust had been laid
by a shower of rain a little before daylight, and the
day therefore was auspicious to the wishes of all who
proposed to assemble at the Sycamore Spring. By
eight o'clock Ante Meridiem, Nicodemus Handy's
barouche, with two beautiful bays, stood upon the
gravel before Handy House on Copperplate Ridge.
Agamemnon Flag, attired in a new blue coat with
figured gilt buttons, white waistcoat, india-rubber
watch-guard, snowy pantaloons of very fine drilling,
and boots of drab prunelle, tipped at the toes with
polished French leather, a watered-silk cravat, and
gold spectacles, sat at the breakfast-table with Mrs.
Handy and Henrietta, her daughter&mdash;the smallest, the
neatest, and the best-shaped female, it is said by those
who pretend to be judges, in Quodlibet.</p>

<p>Nicodemus was in a flurry. He had swallowed his
breakfast with great dispatch, and four servants were
busily in attendance upon him. Sam, the waiter, was
beating time in the hall with a corn whisk alternately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
upon the person of his master and his left hand, after
a very favorite and ingenious fashion of dusting a gentleman's
coat, only known to and practiced by that
musical race of colored dandies, of which Sam was a
first-rate specimen. Sarah, a lady of Sam's complexion,
Mrs. Handy's maid, was running up stairs to sprinkle
some verbena perfume on Mr. Handy's cambric handkerchief;
William was smoothing the nap of his glossy-black
Brewster with a brush as soft as silk; and Mrs.
Trotter, the housekeeper, was arranging a basket of
sandwiches and a bottle of Rudesheimer to be stowed
away in the box of the back seat of the barouche. The
coachman, in a sky-blue frock, and hat with gold band
secured by a huge buckle, was in his seat holding the
reins, every moment speaking to the horses to make
them restive, and then whipping them for not standing
still. The whole scene was one eminently calculated
to disprove that stale Whig slander which purports to
affirm that "all the decency" was in their ranks:&mdash;nothing
could be more striking than this refutation of
it. And as I was myself present&mdash;having called in at
that moment to deliver a message from the New-Light
Club to Mr. Handy, apprising him of their intention
to move that he should act as chairman of the meeting
to be held at the Sycamore Spring&mdash;I witnessed with
lively satisfaction the very decided impression of pleasure
made upon an assemblage of New Lights, who
stood looking on outside of the front gate, by this
triumphant vindication of our party from the malevolent
insinuations of the Whig press.</p>

<p>Agamemnon Flag seemed to be very much at his
ease, and to be thinking but little about the meeting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
while he sat uttering some pleasant things to Miss
Handy;&mdash;at least I suppose they must have been pleasant
to her, as she and her mother both laughed a good
deal at what he said. By-the-by, there is a report in
the Borough, that Ag is making up to this young lady,
which will be a grand thing for him if she favors him,
since she is an only child, and Nicodemus is amazingly
rich.</p>

<p>"God bless me, my dear!" said Mr. Handy, breaking
away from Sam's whisk, and speaking after the manner
of a table of contents, (a habit which he has acquired
since he has grown rich,) "past eight o'clock&mdash;I'm
to be the chairman of that meeting&mdash;ought to be
early on the ground&mdash;five miles off&mdash;no time for nonsense
now&mdash;you and Henrietta and Ag&mdash;have to
drive like lightning&mdash;barbacue, my dear&mdash;want to see
the arrangements before the voters arrive&mdash;the schoolmaster
will take a seat along side of Nace."</p>

<p>"Thank you kindly," said I; "I accept your offer
with great pleasure."</p>

<p>"Shan't want William," he added, referring to the
servant who generally rode with the coachman&mdash;"upon
second thoughts, will put <i>our</i> Secondthoughts inside&mdash;ha!
ha!&mdash;<i>must</i> have William&mdash;<i>shall</i> want him; you
can sit (speaking to me) on the front seat&mdash;Ag and I
behind&mdash;offer the other seat to Barndollar&mdash;want to be
civil to <i>him</i>, my dear&mdash;come, hurry, hurry, hurry!&mdash;William,
get on your livery and be prepared to mount
beside Nace."</p>

<p>As it was very manifest that Mr. Handy was really
in a hurry&mdash;as very opulent men are exceedingly apt
to be&mdash;there was of course a great bustle to accommo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>date
him, by getting off. Agamemnon immediately
rose from the breakfast-table, and, taking up his superfine
Leghorn hat, which was very chastely adorned
with a light yellow ribbon band, the ends whereof hung
a little over the rim, he put it gently on his head, and
then standing before the ladies, asked them with very
apparent complacency, whether they thought he was in
good trim to appear before the Democracy&mdash;and having
received answer that "he was exactly the thing," he
signified his readiness to depart; whereupon we all
bustled out to the barouche and took our seats. William
clambered into his place, and away we went at full trot,
down to The Hero to take up Jacob Barndollar.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the tavern door, we found there
Nim Porter's trotting buggy with his stub-tailed gray.
Nim himself appeared on the steps in a big broad-brimmed
low-crowned Russia blue hat, set very knowingly
over his right eye, with a long taper whip in his
hand; and before we could take up Mr. Barndollar,
this most good natured of bar-keepers, with an agility
not to be expected in so fat a person, sprang up into
his tub-shaped seat, which held him about as compactly
as the shell of an acorn holds the nut, and spreading
the skirts of his green coatee with steel buttons over
the periphery of the same, darted off at a speed of
about fifteen miles to the hour, down the Rumblebottom
road. During this time Mrs. Ferret filled the front
door, and Mrs. Barndollar was looking over her shoulder,
while they both opened their batteries upon poor Jesse
Ferret, in a contemporaneous objurgation of his mean-spiritedness,
addressed to Mr. Handy in the barouche,
but intended for the master of the hotel, who looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
rather sheepishly through the window of the bar-room.
Before he could say anything in his own defense,
and even before the amiable ladies of his family were
done talking, Jacob Barndollar came out, and got into
the barouche; and as Mr. Handy was growing more
and more impatient, he ordered Nace to lose no time,
and so off we started. As well as I could judge,
from looking back, until we turned down by Christy
M'Curdy's mill, Mrs. Ferret was still arguing her case
in the front door of The Hero.</p>

<p>All the roads leading to the Sycamore Spring were
filled with persons on horseback, on foot, in gigs, buggies,
barouches, and rattle-traps of every sort. It
was obvious we were going to have a great meeting.
Before nine o'clock, Mr. Handy was on the ground.
About a hundred persons were already there. Booths
were scattered along under the huge elms and sycamores
which shaded a low flat upon the margin of the Rumblebottom.
The fine, copious, old spring&mdash;where there
has been many a barbacue in my time&mdash;was pouring
out its crystal treasures, as some poet says, with prodigal
bounty, and transferring them, as the Secretary
does the deposits, by large draughts, from the living
rock to the running Rumblebottom&mdash;in fact, taking
them out of one bank, and distributing them between
others. Not far from this spring, adumbrated by over-arching
boughs&mdash;the reader will excuse this poetical
orgasm&mdash;for fifteen years and upwards have I been
visiting this fountain, sacred to Pan, (we used to have
fish frys here,) and have ever grown poetical at the
sight thereof&mdash;it is my infirmity: not far from the
spring stood the tables&mdash;boards on trestles, and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
boards trenchers filled with cubic sections of beef, lamb,
mutton, and ham, interspersed with pyramids of bread&mdash;a
goodly sight! Upon skids, remote from the tables,
stood a barrel of old Monongahela, and hard by in a
cart, tumblers, pitchers, noggins, and bottles. Far off,
at the opposite confine of this field of action, was a
stage erected, with a chair for the President of the day,
and benches of unplaned board for persons of inferior
dignity. Everything was in order; and now that Mr.
Handy had arrived he had nothing to do but wait for
the gathering in of the people.</p>

<p>Presently Mr. Grant, mounted on a large bow-necked
bay, arrived, with his four sons, all men grown, of
a rustic, farmer-like complexion; they were attended
by Augustus Postlethwaite Tompkinson, of The Whole
Team, and some dozen Whigs from Thorough Blue, who
had traveled as far as Mr. Grant's the night before,
and now made a very solid and formidable troop.
Andrew Grant, the candidate, a youth of good presence,
and reputable, (bating his politics,) was of this party.
Andy had been to college, and his father first intended
to make a doctor of him, but the lad somehow took a
dislike to physic, and turned in to this new business of
engineering on canals and railroads, and was considered,
I believe, a tolerably smart hand in that
calling. But as he happened to catch a bilious fever
in the Dismal Swamp, the old lady his mother, who
always had made a pet of him, would not hear of his
going back to that line of livelihood; and so he stayed
at home helping to manage at the Hogback farm, and
doing pretty much as <i>he</i> pleased; until, about a year
before he was brought out, he married Stephen P.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
Crabstock's daughter; and ever since that event does
as his <i>wife</i> pleases&mdash;spending his time one part of the
year at the Iron Works, and the other at the old man's.</p>

<p>By eleven o'clock the company had pretty nearly
got to its maximum. A large party came down in a
wagon from Quodlibet with Abel Brawn&mdash;among them
Neal Hopper, Sandy Buttercrop, Davy Post the
wheelwright, and I can't tell how many more. Quipes,
the painter, borrowed a horse out of Geoffry Wheeler's
team, and was there studying human nature and the
picturesque. Flan Sucker, one-eyed Ben Inky, and
Jeff Drinker, with a squad of regular loafers, came on
foot. The Tumbledownians were there in great force
under Cale Goodfellow, to help Theodore Fog; and
the Bickerbrayians with Virgil Philpot, the editor of
The Scrutinizer, mustered a heavy phalanx in favor
of Ag Flag. To swell the assemblage to its largest
compass, there were about fifty laborers from the
newly-begun Bickerbray and Meltpenny Railroad,
a worthy accession to the New-Light Democracy, who
had about a month before this meeting come into the
State.</p>

<p>This is a hasty glance over the field of action, and
will serve to show that the country was all alive to the
importance of the occasion and duly estimated the
nature of the crisis. Looking over this congregation
I, as one having knowledge therein, may safely affirm,
that the genuine Quods present fully outnumbered the
Whigs three to one. Eliphalet Fox, who has been
more accustomed to measure crowds, however, after a
minute inspection of the various groups, judging by
that tact which he says never failed him in discrimi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>nating
between what he calls a Loco Foco and a Whig,
(he does not pretend to say that he is so expert in
pointing out a New Light, but as to a Loco he asserts
he is perfect,) set down the number at nearer ten to
one; and accordingly so reported it in the account of
the meeting which afterwards appeared in The Whole
Hog. Without, however, dwelling upon this topic, let
us proceed to the business of the day.</p>

<p>At twelve o'clock dinner was announced; and this
army of hungry politicians, with a unanimity of sentiment,
an accord of principle, and a concert of action,
which we might in vain seek for in other occupations
of a political nature, combined, like a band of brothers,
to devour the largest possible amount of the stores
which lay before them. With somewhat less agreement
they made their advances to the Monongahela;
the more shy of the assemblage being rather kept at
bay by the remarkable perseverance and adhesiveness
of Flan Sucker, one-eyed Ben Inky, and a chosen
body of troops under their command, who had constituted
themselves the forlorn hope in this assault. Still,
as the newspapers say when they are disposed to puff a
popular play, the barrel went off very much to the
satisfaction, and, indeed, the delight of the company.</p>

<p>These matters being dispatched, Nicodemus Handy,
who during the repast had acted inimitably the part
of a perfectly ravenous man, but who having an eye
to the sandwiches and Rudesheimer, made his appetite
rather a matter of "seems," rapped upon the table,
and called upon every man to fill up his glass; which
order was faithfully obeyed by Flan Sucker &amp; Com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>pany,
a firm that was in possession of all the tumblers&mdash;the
remainder of the guests allowing the filling to
be, as we say in grammar, "understood,"&mdash;and then
offered the following toast, which, as he said, would
speak for itself:&mdash;"The several candidates who are
about to address the people&mdash;success to him who shall
best deserve it!" Sucker &amp; Company drained to the
bottom, and then set up a shrill yell, very much in the
style of the Winnebagoes, except that there was a
running note of "Yip!" that was distinctively Suckerian.</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen, to the stand!" cried out Mr.
Handy.</p>

<p>But before the crowd obeyed this order, Mr. Snuffers
had a motion to make. It was a matter of some importance,
as the subject was considered in the New-Light
Club, that our party should have the President
of the day&mdash;and it was therefore determined that the
moment dinner was over, and before the Whigs might
be aware of it, Mr. Snuffers, the head of our club,
should rise in some conspicuous place, and move that
Nicodemus Handy be requested to preside over the
meeting. Mr. Snuffers is a slow and nervous man, and
was admonished to be on his guard, so as to make sure
of getting ahead of the Whigs who we knew wanted
Mr. Grant in the chair. He was in consequence very
fidgety all the time of dinner; and now, when the
moment for action arrived, the good old gentleman
elbowed his way toward the center of the table, and
without difficulty succeeded in clambering upon an inverted
and empty flour-barrel, which had once been filled
with bread. "I move, gentlemen," said he, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
tremulous and agitated voice&mdash;"I move, gentlemen,
that Mr. Nicodemus Handy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Before the next word escaped from his lips, this
worthy and respectable old gentleman broke in, and in
an instant (I am shocked to tell it) was jammed up
tight in the barrel&mdash;disappearing as a dip of twenty to
the pound is apt to do when stuck into a black bottle&mdash;"be
President of this meeting," said Mr. Doubleday,
with a hurried utterance, taking up the word which was
lost with Mr. Snuffers, and which, but for the admirable
presence of mind of our Vice, might have been lost
forever.</p>

<p>"Break the barrel to pieces!" cried out forty voices.</p>

<p>"Mr. Snuffers is blue in the face&mdash;he will die of
apoplexy," cried out others.</p>

<p>"An ax!&mdash;knock the barrel to pieces!" shouted
more, in great alarm at his precarious situation.</p>

<p>In a few moments our distressed and worthy President
of the New Light was extricated from his unpleasant
durance, and finding no harm done, we proceeded
to take the question on the motion. Mr. Handy
was thus called to the chair. Nine Vice-Presidents
were appointed, and six Secretaries to record the proceedings.
These matters being arranged, the whole
assemblage moved toward the rostrum at the opposite
end of the wood.</p>

<p class="chapt-summary smaller">SCENES AT THE SYCAMORE SPRING&mdash;NICODEMUS HANDY'S SPEECH AS
PRESIDENT&mdash;SKETCH OF ANDREW GRANT'S SPEECH&mdash;AGAMEMNON
FLAG'S&mdash;ATTEMPTS AT INTERRUPTION&mdash;THEODORE FOG'S CELEBRATED
SPEECH ON THIS OCCASION&mdash;ELOQUENT EXPOSITION OF PRINCIPLES&mdash;HIS
TRIUMPH&mdash;HIS MISFORTUNE&mdash;QUIPES'S DISAPPOINTMENT
OF HIS FRIENDS.</p>

<p class="p2">When the crowd had gathered around the stand appropriated
to the President, the nine Vice-Presidents,
and the six Secretaries, besides the speakers who were
to address the meeting, and when every officer was in
his place, Nicodemus Handy came forward with his
pocket-handkerchief in his hand, wiping from his brow
the perspiration, which naturally breaks out on a man
of sensibility and wealth when called to discharge the
honorable and responsible function of presiding over a
vast concourse of freemen. By way of digression, I
would take this occasion to remark upon the extreme
appropriateness of the phrase which is now universally
used in describing meetings of the people, and which
always refers to them as <i>freemen</i>. Ever since the
people have been drilled to walk in the way appointed
for them by the leaders of their respective parties, and
are so liberally told how they must think, speak, and
vote; and when no man is allowed to walk out of that
path without being threatened with condign punishment,
it is extremely proper, in order to avoid odious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
imputations which malevolent observers might cast
upon them, on all occasions to employ the phrase I
have alluded to; since, if this were neglected, these
malevolent observers might take it into their heads to
call the people of our free Republic Tools, Instruments,
Rank-and-File, and other names significant of a
state of subserviency, which in the eyes of strangers
might cast discredit on our free institutions: even the
<i>officers</i> of our government might be branded with the
name of <i>hirelings</i> and <i>servants</i>, and an opinion might
thus be fostered that, instead of being the freest nation
upon earth, we were a set of slaves governed by a set
of hired servants&mdash;a most unwarrantable, unjust, and
derogatory conclusion. For this reason, I am particular
in the language above employed, and I think that every
genuine Quod will see the value and the force of my
vindication and use of this phrase.</p>

<p>Mr. Handy rose to his feet, wiped his brow, and
made a graceful obedience to the assembled body of
freemen.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said he, with a most laudable diffidence,
in a voice which not more than fifteen persons,
exclusive of the nine Vices and six Secretaries, could
hear; "sensible of the great honor&mdash;endeavor to discharge
with fidelity&mdash;obvious incapacity&mdash;but exceedingly
flattered by the testimony of your confidence;"
then wiping his brow, still more vehemently, with his
cambric handkerchief rolled up like a snow-ball, he
continued: "It falls to my lot to introduce to you our
distinguished friends, Agamemnon Flag, Andrew Grant,
and Theodore Fog, Esquires, men of whom any land
may be proud&mdash;they will speak for themselves. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
such men to choose from, our country cannot fail to
rise up to the very midnight of prosperity, honor, and
renown. Thanks for your attention&mdash;rely upon your
indulgence&mdash;Mr. Grant will lead off."</p>

<p>"Three cheers for Nicodemus Handy!" cried out
several Quods, as soon as our distinguished townsman
took his seat; and, thereupon, about twenty heads were
uncovered, and the twenty throats appurtenant to the
same gave the three rounds called for.</p>

<p>Andrew Grant now came forward, and made a discourse
of about an hour's length. It was in the usual
style of the Whigs, and began with an attempt to raise
an impression that the country, notwithstanding General
Jackson's express declaration to the contrary, given
to the nation under the solemn sanction of a presidential
message, and notwithstanding his successor's certificate
to the same effect, was in a state of difficulty and distress.
This young man, not more than twenty-five
years of age, living in comparative obscurity, had the
hardihood, in the face of a large and respectable body
of freemen, to contradict the word of two Presidents
of the United States! Then, after coloring this picture
of adversity with all imaginable hues of shade, he did
not scruple to affirm that the whole of these fancied
embarrassments were brought on by the <i>folly</i>, as he
termed it, of our rulers&mdash;charged the great Democratic
majority of the nation with having carried bad measures
through Congress&mdash;said the Whigs had warned us
of the results of these measures&mdash;and even went to the
point of asserting that the suspension of the banks
was the consequence of the acts of the party in power.
To make out this absurd proposition, he read extracts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
from the speeches of Whig members, against the removal
of the deposits, to show what he called their prophecies
of disaster to the people; then actually affirmed
that the experiment of General Jackson upon the Currency
had failed, and that all the Whig predictions had
come true; and after sundry excursions into the Hard
Money and State-Bank systems of the administration,
finally wound up his remarks by a very fatiguing enumeration
of the General's pledges to the people before
his election, and his changes of opinion upon these
subjects afterward;&mdash;in regard to which he produced
and read certain long-winded documents from the
President and Secretaries, to the great annoyance of
our Quods, who, in fact, became so tired of this impertinent
matter, that not more than half a dozen of
them remained within hearing of the speaker, the great
bulk of them having gone over to the spring to refresh
themselves in a more agreeable manner. Eliphalet Fox
very aptly remarked, immediately after this long prosing
was brought to an end, that the speech was a <i>perfect
failure</i>: he had heard Andy Grant spoken of as a
young man of talents, but he turns out to be a miserable
take-in. "Nothing in him, sir!" said Eliphalet,
in his terse way; "nothing in him, sir!"</p>

<p>The Whigs, as is usual with them, affected to be
hugely delighted. Augustus Postlethwaite Tompkinson
took pencil-notes and announced his purpose to publish
the speech entire. "A great speech that," said he to
Mr. Snuffers&mdash;"extraordinary young man!&mdash;great
speech."</p>

<p>Mr. Handy now lost no time in presenting Agamemnon
Flag, who came forward with a confident,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
self-possessed air, smiling through his gold spectacles,
and apparently very much delighted at the opportunity
of presenting himself before his fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>"I see before me," said he, in a clear, fine-toned
voice, and with an affable manner, "a vast concourse
of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Put on your hat," cried out three or four from the
crowd, upon observing that a sunbeam had straggled
through the foliage and lit up Agamemnon's yellow,
curly locks, likening them to golden wire.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my friends," said the orator, stepping
one pace to the right and thus bringing himself into
the shade, "in the presence of the sovereign people, I
always stand uncovered, regardless of the exposure of
my person."</p>

<p>This happy sally brought forth a long and loud
clapping of hands from the great multitude of Quods,
who, the moment Andy Grant had finished speaking,
had crowded back to the stand.</p>

<p>"Take off your goold specs, Ag; let's see your
Dimmycratic phiz out and out!" said Flan Sucker at
the top of his voice, from the outskirts of the assemblage.</p>

<p>A loud laugh that shook full one hundred diaphragms,
followed this demand, and Agamemnon good-naturedly
took off his glasses.</p>

<p>"Anything to oblige you, gentlemen," said he; "but
as I am very short-sighted, I deprive myself of the
pleasure of a better view of my worthy fellow-citizens."</p>

<p>"Put on your specs, Ag," said Nim Porter&mdash;"never
mind Flan Sucker!"</p>

<p>"Put on your specs!" cried out the whole of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
convention who had nominated the ticket, backed by a
number of their friends."</p>

<p>"Blast his eyes!" said Cale Goodfellow, turning to
his Tumbledownians, who were all friends of Fog, and
of course opposed to the nomination. "Let's have a
representative who can <i>see</i> what he is about&mdash;none of
your goold daylights!"</p>

<p>"Specs or no specs, go it!&mdash;Yip!" shouted Flan.
Sucker, with a voice that rang like a trumpet.</p>

<p>"Or-der!&mdash;Or-der!" said Mr. Handy, rising from
his seat and coming forward beside the speaker, and
waving his hand to the crowd, greatly concerned to see
these manifestations of dissension in the ranks of the
party. "Gentlemen, it is but fair that every man
should be heard, and the chair takes occasion to say,
that it is mortified at these interruptions. If the gentlemen
opposed to the nomination&mdash;the chair alludes
to those who have unfortunately allowed themselves to
be influenced by the iron railing, a subject which has
nothing upon earth to do with the pending election&mdash;if
these gentlemen are not disposed to give Mr. Agamemnon
Flag an opportunity of delivering himself, the
chair would invite such persons to reflect upon the
obvious impropriety of such a course. The chair is
persuaded that this disturbance results from mere
want of reflection, and hopes it shall not be required
again to remind gentlemen of the courtesy due to Mr.
Flag."</p>

<p>As Virgil describes in that notable passage, the
subduing of the rage of popular commotion by &AElig;neas,
and likens it to the mandate of Neptune quelling the
waves of old ocean, so fell Mr. Handy's timely reproof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
upon the Anti-iron Railings, and, in a moment, all was
still. Agamemnon then began again in his original
track.</p>

<p>"I see before me a vast concourse of free citizens&mdash;the
solid, substantial, durable, permanent, everlasting
pillars of free government. The honest, upright, pure,
hard-handed, horny-fisted, Democratic yeomanry of
the country are here&mdash;not the flesh and blood of the
country, for that is the pampered aristocracy&mdash;but the
bone and sinew surround me. It rejoices my eyes to
behold these honest, sturdy, independent, intelligent,
invincible tillers of the soil&mdash;these brawny, unconquerable,
liberty-loving working-men&mdash;I say, sir, I delight
to look upon them; my feeble vision, sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Put on your specs, Ag!" shouted Ben Inky and
Flan Sucker again, at the same instant;&mdash;and the cry
was echoed from various quarters.</p>

<p>Some moments of disorder again prevailed, which
required the second interposition of Mr. Handy, who,
in the most spirited manner, proclaimed his positive
determination to resign, unless the order of the meeting
could be preserved. "I will never consent," said he,
with a most laudable energy, "to hold any post, executive
or representative, for one moment after I shall
have discovered that I do not possess the confidence
of the people; the chair must feel itself compelled, by
every sentiment which, as a friend of the New-Light
Democracy, it holds dear, to resign the moment it finds
that it has fallen into a minority." Then followed these
remarkable words:&mdash;"Sustain me, Quodlibetarians, or
let me go!"</p>

<p>For full five minutes after this, the uproar was tre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>mendous.
The Iron Railings and Anti-iron Railings
almost came to blows. The Tumbledownians and
Bickerbrayians took their appropriate sides in the
contest, and, for a space, nothing was heard but shouts
of Fog!&mdash;Flag!&mdash;Fog!&mdash;Flag! over the whole field.
When both parties had bawled themselves perfectly
hoarse, and for mere want of wind ceased the clamor,
Theodore Fog mounted the hustings, and made a special
request of his friends to keep the peace and hear Mr.
Flag to an end. He put this request upon the ground
of a personal favor to himself, and promised them that,
at the proper time, they should hear his sentiments
very fully upon all the agitating questions of the day.</p>

<p>This appeal was conclusive, and Mr. Flag once more
presented himself. But the interruptions he had suffered
seemed most unhappily to have thrown him
entirely out of gear; and becoming very much embarrassed,
he struggled for some moments to regain his
self-possession, as I thought, without success&mdash;although
Fox thought otherwise,&mdash;and, after less than half an
hour's speaking, sat down, rather crest-fallen and mortified.</p>

<p>I may unwittingly do Mr. Flag injustice in this remark;
for, in truth, my mind was greatly occupied
with the tumult, and I confess I was, therefore, not a
very attentive listener. Fox, on the contrary, was
minutely observant of the speech, and did not scruple
to pronounce it a masterly effort of eloquence, calculated
to place Mr. Flag beside the first statesmen of
our country. This was his opinion at the time, and
it was even more warmly and eulogistically expressed
subsequently, in The Whole Hog, where the speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
appeared in nine closely-printed columns on the following
Saturday.</p>

<p>Theodore Fog was always a great favorite at our
public meetings, and the moment now approached
when the field was to be surrendered to him. The New
Lights, including the members of the nominating convention
and the friends of the Iron Railing Compromise,
backed by Virgil Philpot of The Scrutinizer, and a
large force of Bickerbrayians, were determined that
Agamemnon Flag should not want a very decisive
token of applause; and they accordingly called out for
"nine cheers for the regular candidate!" Responsive
to this call, their whole party lustily set about the
work; and, for some minutes after the conclusion of
Agamemnon's speech, the air resounded with huzzas
for "Flag and the Constitution!" "New Light and
Regular Nomination!" This was answered by a round
for "Fog and Reform!" "Retrenchment and no Iron
Railing!" and Fog, in the midst of this acclamation,
appearing on the speaker's stand, all cries were lost in
the most violent clapping of hands.</p>

<p>Theodore Fog's figure is about six feet, lean and
bony, and with a stoop which inclines a little to the
right, so as to bring his left shoulder somewhat higher
than its opposite. His arms are unusually long, his head
small, his face strongly furrowed with deep lines, his
eyes of a greenish luster, his nose decidedly of the pug
species, his mouth large, his complexion of that sallow,
drum-head, parchment hue that equally defies the war
of the elements, and the ravages of alcohol. Although
short of fifty years of age, his hair is iron gray, and
spreads in a thick mat over his whole cranium. At no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
time of life has he been careful of dress, but now has
declined into an extreme of negligence in this particular.
On the present occasion, he wore a striped
gingham coat, rather short in the sleeves, and cross-barred
pantaloons; his shirt collar was turned down
over a narrow, horsehair stock; and a broad black
ribbon guard crossed his breast and terminated in the
right pocket of a black bombazet waistcoat, where it
was plainly to be seen from the external impression,
lodged a large watch. He presented himself to the
multitude, holding in his hand a rather shabby straw
hat, which he, nevertheless, flourished with the air and
grace of one who had known better days than his
habiliments seemed to denote.</p>

<p>He stood for some time bowing and waving his hat
in return for the clamorous approbation with which he
was greeted; and when, at length, silence was restored,
he began his speech.</p>

<p>"Countrymen and friends: you of Quodlibet, Bickerbray,
Tumbledown and the adjacent parts, hear
me! I am an old, tried and trusty, unflinching and
unterrified Quodlibetarian New-Light Democrat&mdash;Flan
Sucker, bring us a tumbler of water&mdash;tangle it, Flan:
no hypocrisy in me, gentlemen,&mdash;I go for the ardent.
You all know I am, and was from the first, opposed to
the iron railing&mdash;(here arose a cheer from the Anties)&mdash;but
I don't come to talk to you about that. You
know, moreover, that I am an anti-nomination man&mdash;I'm
out on independent grounds&mdash;every man for himself,
as the jackass said to the chickens&mdash;(a loud laugh.)
I want to say a word about Agamemnon Flag&mdash;commonly
called Ag Flag. Who's he? Look at them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
gold spectacles, and you will see what he is at once.
When the plastic hand of Dame Nature set about the
fabrication of that masterpiece of human mechanism,
a genuine, out-and-out thorough-stiched New-Light
Democrat, she never thought of sticking upon him a
nose to be ridden by two gold rings hung over it like a
pair of saddlebags&mdash;(loud laughter.) We have other
uses for our gold; we want it for mint-drops&mdash;old Tom
Benton's mint-drops&mdash;to be run up into them, to give
the honest, poor man something better, when his week's
work is done, than Copperplate Bank rags, signed
Nicodemus Handy&mdash;(loud shouts and cheers from Flan
Sucker's squad and the Tumbledowns; and groans and
hisses from the Convention men and Bickerbrays.)
Friends, I tell you, our party is split; emphatically
split. I have seen this coming for some time. We
have three sets of New Lights among us, and it is time
we should know it. There are <span class="smcap">the Mandarins</span>, our
big bugs, and I could name them to you. You will
find them on Copperplate Ridge&mdash;('Bah! bah!' from
the New-Light Club&mdash;'Go it The! go it, old fellow!'
from the Anties.) You will find them at Popular Flats&mdash;('That
won't do!' cried fifty voices; 'three cheers
for the Hon. Middleton Flam!'&mdash;loud cheering for
Flam: 'Walk into them, Fog!' from the Anties&mdash;great
laughter and rubbing of hands among the Whigs.) You
will find them in the Forwarding and Commission Line&mdash;(great
uproar on all sides.) After the Mandarins,
come <span class="smcap">the Middlings</span>; and after the Middlings, <span class="smcap">the
True Grits</span>&mdash;the hearty, whole-souled, no-mistake
Quods. I'm a <span class="smcap">True Grit</span>!&mdash;(great applause.) We
are nature's noblemen&mdash;give me that water, Flan. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
call myself one of the Royal Family of the Sovereign
People&mdash;(renewed laughter and applause.) I am
no kid-glove-<span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>-Democrat: I am no milk-and-water,
flesh-and-fowl, half-hawk-half-buzzard-<span class="smcap">Middling</span>-Democrat:
I am, to all intents and purposes,
toties quoties, in puris naturalibus, a <span class="smcap">True Grit</span>, a
whole <span class="smcap">True Grit</span>, and nothing but a <span class="smcap">True Grit</span>.&mdash;(Here
Theodore was obliged to pause a full minute on
account of the cheering.)</p>

<p>"Now this brings me," he continued after drinking
off the potation which Flan Sucker had assiduously
placed upon the stand for his use, "to Andy Grant.
Andy Grant has told you a great deal about General
Jackson's pledges, and his changes and whatnot. Well,
sirs, he <i>did</i> change&mdash;what of it? Is Democracy like
the laws of the Medes and Persians? Is that great
sublime truth which vivifies the patriot's heart, resuscitates
his ambition and sparkles in the human breast,
like a stone in the bottom of a well, for toads to sit on?
or is it the divine rainbow spanning the earth with its
arch, and changing with the sun, now in the east, now
in the west? Is it a post set up in a stream for the
liquid element of human policy forever to roll by and
leave behind? or is it the mighty mass of steam power
that not only floats upon that element, but flies onward
across the great ocean of mortal things forever changing
in its career? Is not Democracy itself the march
of intellect? and does not marching consist in change
of place? I hear you all answer, with one accord,
Ay, ay, ay!&mdash;(Taking the word from the orator, there
was a loud affirmative response to these questions.)</p>

<p>"Well, then, Jackson did change. He was <i>for</i> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
single term&mdash;he was <i>against</i> it: I confess the fact. He
was <i>for</i> the Protective System&mdash;he was <i>against</i> it: I
agree to it. He was <i>for</i> a National Bank&mdash;he was
<i>against</i> it: what of that? He was <i>for</i> the distribution
of the surplus, and again he was <i>against</i> it; I know it.
He was <i>for</i> Internal Improvements;&mdash;he changed his
mind&mdash;he was <i>against</i> them. Then again, sirs, he was
<i>against</i> the interference of officers in the elections;&mdash;he
was sorry for it, and took the other tack. He was
<i>against</i> the appointment of members of Congress&mdash;in
theory;&mdash;in practice he was <i>for</i> it. He was <i>against</i>
this Sub-Treasury&mdash;and perhaps he is now <i>for</i> it. It
is all true, as Andy Grant has told you:&mdash;it is in the
documents, I don't deny it. Sirs, it is the glory of his
character that he has been <i>for</i> and <i>against</i> everything;&mdash;and
as Mr. Van Buren promises to follow in his footsteps,
he, of course, will be for and against everything&mdash;I
know him. He would not be a genuine New Light,
if he were not. We are all (and here Fog raised his
voice to the highest key, and struck the board sharply
with his hand) <span class="smcap lowercase">FOR</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">AGAINST</span> everything! How
else can we be with the majority? What is the New-Light
Quodlibetarian Democracy, but a strict conformity
to the will of the majority? Against that and
that only we never go!&mdash;(tremendous applause.) As
Levi Beardsly said, Perish Commerce, Perish Credit!&mdash;and
I say, Perish Currency, Banks, Sub-Treasury,
Constitution, Law, Benton, Amos, Van&mdash;I had almost
said perish Old Hickory&mdash;but <i>always</i> go with the <span class="smcap lowercase">MAJORITY</span>!"</p>

<p>After this burst, which may be said to be truly eloquent,
Theodore made a very happy hit in touching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
upon the natural hostility between the <i>rich</i> and the
<i>poor</i>, showing, with great point of remark, how impossible
it was for these two classes to have any Christian
feelings toward each other; and arguing from
that the great New-Light Democratic principle, that in
every department of the government any man who
holds property ought to be deprived of all influence,
and that it was the poor man's right to legislate away
the rich man's possessions. "Do we not know," said
he, "that in every community the majority are poor?
that there are two men without property for every one
man with it? Of course then, it follows logically, that,
as two heads are better than one, the sole right, as well
as the sole power of legislation is in the poor, and that
they may make laws for the government of the rich;
but the rich cannot make laws for the government of
the poor. Besides, who would be the most impartial
in such a matter, the man legislating for his <i>own</i> property,
or the man legislating for his <i>neighbor's</i>? This
requires no reply."</p>

<p>Upon the subject of the Sub-Treasury, Fog avowed
boldly his non-commitalism. "I am not sure, at this
moment," said he, "how the land lies. I wait to
ascertain the sentiment of the majority, which, without
taking sides, I rather incline to think is against
the measure. I judge from the vote of the New Lights
two years ago&mdash;although, I confess, that two years are
a long period for a New Light to look back, and that
it is rather over the usual time in which custom requires
we should change. <i>I shall wait for events.</i>"</p>

<p>There were other subjects embraced in this speech,
upon which my memoranda are imperfect; but there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
was one part of it, toward the conclusion, which was
very pathetic.</p>

<p>The orator turned to those strangers among us who
had come over from the Bickerbray and Meltpenny
Railroad. "Gentlemen," said he, "you stand in a
peculiarly interesting relation to the New Lights. You
are strangers, and, as the poet says,</p>

<p>
'Stranger is a sacred name.'<br />
</p>

<p>Therefore, it is our wish to take you in. You have
not been over sixty days in our State: you are separated,
many of you, from your sweethearts&mdash;some of
you from your wives&mdash;all of you from your homes:&mdash;wife&mdash;sweetheart&mdash;home!
Affecting words!</p>

<p>
'Where is the man with soul so dead<br />
Who never to himself hath said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This is my own, my native land?' and so forth."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Here Theodore took up his red pocket-handkerchief,
which was already well saturated with the sweat of his
brow, and feelingly wiped his eyes for some moments,
manifestly overcome by his emotions. At length he
proceeded.</p>

<p>"Do not despond, gentlemen&mdash;do not despair. The
New Lights are your friends, and not only shall you
find wife, sweetheart, home&mdash;ay, and children, in Quodlibet,
but if you are here next month, we will see if
some of you are not entitled to a vote&mdash;that's all.&mdash;I
have no doubt a large portion of your respectable body
are better voters than you think you are. And at all
events, if you are not, it becomes us as a Christian
people to extend to you that privilege. I go for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
repeal of all laws which tyrannically require a year's
residence in the State, before a stranger is allowed to
vote."</p>

<p>"Hurra for Fog&mdash;hurra for Fog!" burst forth in
loud chorus from the new-comers.</p>

<p>"But," said Theodore in continuation, "as I scorn
concealment, I must be frank with you. The stranger
should be grateful to his friends; and I, therefore, for
one, never can consent to extend the invaluable privilege
of suffrage to an unworthy man. He must be a
New Light, an ardent, unblenching Quodlibetarian
Democrat, ready to go in whatever way we who take
the trouble to do his thinking for him, require;&mdash;it is
but reasonable. We think, study, burn the midnight
lamp, and toil, when he sleeps, and all for the good of
the man who has no time to do these things for himself&mdash;what
is his duty in return? Why, to stand by
<i>us</i> who make these sacrifices for his welfare&mdash;clearly&mdash;undoubtedly&mdash;incontestably."</p>

<p>"Hurra for Fog!" again rose in hoarse reduplications
on the air.</p>

<p>"And now, fellow-countrymen, one and all&mdash;men
of Quodlibet, men of Bickerbray&mdash;and especially men
of Old Tumbledown, long my home, and never absent
from my heart&mdash;I have exposed to you frankly, freely,
unhesitatingly my principles and professions.&mdash;You
see me as I am&mdash;naked, guileless, and robed in the
simplicity of my nature.&mdash;Flan, another glass of that
stuff, my boy. I do not imitate my friend Andy
Grant&mdash;for he <i>is</i> my friend&mdash;we can differ in politics
and break no scores!&mdash;I do not, like him and the
Whigs, entertain you with frothy declamation, appeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>ing
to your passions or your prejudices&mdash;I scorn such
stratagems.&mdash;No, I address myself solely and severely,
sternly, without a flower, prosaically, without a figure,
soberly, without a flight, to your cool, temperate, and
unseduced capacity of logical deduction. Yes, gentlemen,
I, a poor man, do battle against the hosts of
the rich. I, the friend of honest labor, struggle
against the huge monopoly of hoarded wealth, hoarded
by grinding the faces of our sterling but destitute
laboring men&mdash;alone, I strive against these banded
powers&mdash;will you desert me in the strife?"</p>

<p>"Never!" cried Flan Sucker, Ben Inky, and six
more of Fog's principal men&mdash;-"Never, never!"</p>

<p>"Then I am content. Come weal, come woe, here
is a heart that will never&mdash;or rather, gentlemen, let
me say in the words of the poet&mdash;(it now became
quite obvious that Theodore was beginning to be very
seriously affected by the frequent refreshment which
Flan Sucker had administered during his speech,)</p>

<p>
'Come one, come all, this rock shall fly<br />
From his firm base as soon as I.'<br />
</p>

<p>"In conclusion, all I have to say is this&mdash;We are
about to part.&mdash;When you go to your homes, and with
hearts enraptured by all a father's and a husband's
failings&mdash;feelings&mdash;you take your seats beside the old
family firesides, and with the partners of your bosoms
getting supper, and your interesting progeny clustering
on your knees,&mdash;in the midst of all these blessings
pause to ask yourselves, what are they? Your hearts
will answer, they are <i>our Country</i>! How then, you
will inquire, is that country to be preserved, as a rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
inheritance to these cherubs?&mdash;who by this time have
climbed as high as your waistcoat pockets, into which
they have, with the natural instinct of young New
Lights, thrust their little fingers&mdash;the response will be
ready&mdash;Go to the polls in October&mdash;go, determined to
sustain the everlasting principles of the New-Light
Quodlibetarian Democracy&mdash;go, with a firm resolve to
support no Mandarin, no Middling, but to sustain an
unadulterated True Grit:&mdash;go, to vote for Theodore
Fog, and your country shall be forever great, prosperous
and happy."</p>

<p>A wave of the hand and a bow showed that Theodore
had uttered his last words&mdash;upon which several rounds
of applause, resembling the simultaneous clapping of
wings and crowing of an acre of cocks, more than
anything else I can imagine, shook the firmament,
and, as the old song has it, "made the welkin roar."
A party of Tumbledownians, instigated by Cale Goodfellow&mdash;(a
wag who follows sporting, and keeps a
bank&mdash;I mean a faro bank&mdash;at Tumbledown, a most
special friend of Theodore's)&mdash;rushed up to the platform,
and, seizing the orator in their arms, bore him off
in triumph to the spring, where they fell to celebrating
their victory, in advance of the election, over a fresh
supply of spirits produced by Cale Goodfellow for the
occasion. The result was that Theodore was obliged
to be taken home to Quodlibet in a condition which
Mr. Handy, who is President of the Temperance
Society, pronounced to be perfectly shocking.</p>

<p>Some speaking took place after this by several volunteers:
but from the agitated condition of the assemblage,
and the prevalence of uproar, nothing worthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
of notice transpired, and by sundown nearly all who
could get away had retired.</p>

<p>Quipes had been an attentive observer of the earlier
scenes of the day, and as he had his drawing-book
with him, we had reason to expect some spirited
sketches of the crowd; but the poor fellow, being
fatigued and thirsty, and of a singularly weak head,
was overtaken by his drought, and was laid away in the
afternoon in Abel Brawn's wagon, in which he was
brought to Quodlibet, Neal Hopper undertaking to
ride his horse back to the Borough.</p>

<p>The result of this day's proceedings was unfavorable
to the regular nomination, and highly auspicious to
Theodore Fog. It was very evident that The Split was
going to do us a great deal of harm, and this gave
much uneasiness to the club. The Whigs seemed to
consider it a good omen, and old Mr. Grant and his
party left the field in high spirits.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

PRINCIPLES&mdash;HIS GOOD-NATURED ENCOURAGEMENT OF JESSE FERRET&mdash;DABBS'S
TREAT.</p>

<p class="p2">The proceedings at the Sycamore Spring furnished
melancholy evidence of the serious character of the
split which had taken place in our ranks. This was a
source of anxious and painful reflection to the New
Lights. But the assiduity with which we endeavored
to heal this dissension only made matters worse. The
Whole Team, which, although not within the county,
claimed to take a deep interest in this election, on the
score of being within our congressional district, noticed
our divisions with much self-gratulation, and made the
best of them, by attacking Agamemnon Flag as "the
creature" (to use its own unscrupulous language) of the
Hon. Middleton Flam; while, at the same time, it opened
the flood-gates of its abuse upon Theodore Fog, as a
man of "bad habits, loose manners, and objectionable
morals." The Bickerbray Scrutinizer was devoted to
Flag and the regular ticket, and therefore defended
Agamemnon against The Whole Team, and let fly
several arrows against Theodore Fog; thus unhappily
fomenting the differences among our friends.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>The course pursued by Eliphalet Fox, at this difficult
juncture, was one calculated to raise him in the esteem
of every true Quod, and to place him on a pinnacle
among editors. He took none of those middle grounds
which scarcely ever fail to bring a politician into contempt
with both parties&mdash;but, with a boldness entirely
peculiar to himself, and in the highest degree illustrative
of the New-Light theory, stoutly advocated each
of our candidates, as the course of the canvass seemed
to encourage their respective chances of success. Thus,
when Theodore Fog first announced himself as the independent
candidate, and when every one appeared to
regard this step as an act of presumption which could
not but result in defeat, Eliphalet put forth the following
paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Mister</i> Theodore Fog, of this Borough, an old
practitioner at <i>more than one bar</i>, having waked up
one morning with the idea that he was born to fill the
measure of his country's glory, as well as he fills that
of his own every night, has conceived the sublime project
of running on an independent ticket, in the approaching
election. We would whisper in our friend
The.'s ear, that he has barked up the wrong tree. Independence
is not a word to be found in the New-Light
dictionary. The voters of this county can never be
seduced from the support of the regular nomination;
especially when it is headed by such a man as Agamemnon
Flag, whose eloquence, accomplishments, and
remarkable Democratic simplicity of manners, as well
as his perfect surrender of himself to the cause of his
Party, give him the highest claim to the consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
of every right-minded and unadulterated Quod. Verb.
sap. sat."</p></div>

<p>Now, after the meeting of the Sycamore Spring, a
new view of matters broke upon Eliphalet's vision.
He was certainly taken by surprise at the demonstration
which that meeting afforded of Theodore's strength
with the voters; and in the account of that event, which
appeared in The Whole Hog on the succeeding Saturday,
one scarcely knows whether most to commend
the sincerity of the writer, or the justness of the
tribute paid to the masterly effort of Mr. Fog.
Speaking of that effort, the editor employs this
language:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In regard to our esteemed fellow-townsman, Theodore
Fog, the public expectation was more than realized.
This unstudied orator, with all the freshness impressed
upon his mind by the mint of nature herself, contemning
the aid of tinsel show, and presenting himself
in the homely habiliments of an unvarnished, and,
as our adversaries scoffingly add, of an unwashed New
Light, poured forth a resistless flood of native oratory,
remarkable for that massive vigor of thought, and
that felicity of expression, which are the rare endowments
only of genius, trained <i>among</i> the people, and
whose soul is <i>with</i> the people. He descanted upon the
brilliant career of our never-sufficiently-to-be-flattered
administration, with an effect that thrilled in the pulse,
glowed in the countenance, and broke forth in the
reiterated shouts of every warm-hearted, straight-out,
lead-following, unagainst-the-wishes-or-commands-of-the
luminaries-of-the-party-rebelling New-Light Democrat
on the ground. We are happy to add our decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
conviction that the election of this staunch champion
of the <i>real</i> New Lights is placed beyond a doubt."</p></div>

<p>The intrepidity of this paragraph will strike every
one who reflects that the canvass, at the time this appeared,
was far from being brought to a close; and
that the result, whatever Eliphalet might have thought
of it, was deemed exceedingly doubtful. Indeed, we
had subsequently a proof given to us, in The Whole
Hog itself, that very serious opinions began to prevail
against the possibility of Mr. Fog's carrying the day,
in opposition to Flag.</p>

<p>The New-Light Club, with some few and unimportant
exceptions, had determined, as they thought themselves
in duty bound, to sustain the regular ticket, and for
this purpose, when matters were running very strong
for Fog, and when, indeed, they began to entertain a
well-grounded fear that Andy Grant might slip in by
the aid of these divisions, resolved upon having a night
procession in the Borough. This expedient we have
always resorted to with the happiest effects whenever
we have found the hopes of the New Lights beginning
to ebb; it serves to animate our friends, by throwing,
as it were, a glare over their minds, and to render
them more docile to the word of command from those
who take upon themselves the labor of judging for the
multitude. We now had recourse to this device with a
very flattering, though as it turned out in the end, a
deceptive manifestation of its influence upon the election.
The procession was made; paper lanterns in
abundance, bearing a variety of inscriptions of the
most encouraging exhortation to the friends of Flag
and the Ticket, were procured for the occasion. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
lantern and every banner had written upon it <span class="smcap">Flam</span>,
in the hope thus to identify the ticket with our distinguished
representative in Congress, and bring in
the aid of his great name to our cause. Mottoes,
having reference to "the Old Hero of the Hermitage,"
were also profusely used, and even the Hickory Tree
was reared aloft in the procession, covered with small
cup lamps in imitation of its fruit. Every one in
Quodlibet supposed that this stroke of the procession
settled the matter. It undoubtedly converted the
Borough and brought it into the utmost harmony on
our side. But the Tumbledownians, among whom
Fog's great strength was found, were not there; and
from Bickerbray the delegation was not as large as it
ought to have been. Still, the evidence of popular
support to the ticket was deemed conclusive; so much
so, that Eliphalet Fox's next editorial referred to it as
"indicative of the stern resolve of the New Lights,
once and forever, to crush the insubordinate and rebellious
temper with which certain factious and discontented
pretenders to the name of Democrats had
endeavored to sow discord in the ranks of the faithful,
by setting up the absurd doctrine of independent
opinion&mdash;a doctrine so fatal to the New-Light Democracy
wherever it has been allowed. Agamemnon
Flag," the editor proceeded to remark, "was not a man
to be put down by the frothy, ginger-pop eloquence
engendered in the hot atmosphere of cock-tail and
julep manufactories. Mr. Fog may now perceive that
his secret perambulations to spread dissension in the
New-Light ranks, and his hypocritical boast of Independence
will be scowled upon by every honest eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
and spurned by every honest tongue which are to be
found among the high-minded New-Light yeomanry
of Quodlibet, Bickerbray, Tumbledown, and the adjacent
parts."</p>

<p>The election soon after this took place, when,
greatly to the astonishment of our club, and in fact
of the whole party, the result was announced to be as
set forth in this table:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Election result">
<tr>
<td class="tdc" colspan="2"><i>Quods.</i></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td class="tdc" colspan="2"><i>Whig.</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Theodore Fog,</td><td class="tdr">1191.</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td class="tdl">Andrew Grant,</td><td class="tdr">1039.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Abram Schoolcraft,</td> <td class="tdr">1084.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Curtius Short,</td> <td class="tdr">1063.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Agamemnon Flag,</td> <td class="tdr">758.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Thus it appeared that Theodore Fog far outran the
rest of the ticket, and that Agamemnon Flag fell considerably
below the Whig vote.</p>

<p>Eliphalet Fox, greatly delighted at the triumph of
this election, lost no time in publishing a handbill announcing
the issue. It was headed</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Glorious Victory! Quodlibet Erect!</span>"</p></div>

<p>and proceeded to descant on the event in this wise:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We have never for a moment permitted ourselves
to doubt that our estimable fellow-townsman Theodore
Fog, one of the purest, most disinterested and ablest
Democrats of the glorious New-Light Quodlibetarian
School, would lead the polls; and, indeed, we took
occasion to insinuate as much after his celebrated
speech at the Sycamore Spring, which it was our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
good fortune to hear, and which, as an exposition
of sound New-Light principles, gave us such unmixed
delight. We cannot but feel regret that Mr. Flag's
friends should have so inconsiderately consented to
place his name on the ticket, before they had ascertained
Mr. Fog's views in regard to the election. An
understanding upon this subject would have saved
them the mortification of presenting a name which,
from the first, we felt a presentiment was destined to
incur defeat; and it would have spared Mr. Flag the
pain he must suffer in the present event. The youth
of this gentleman, his want of acquaintance with the
people, arising, doubtless, from the imperfection of his
vision, and his unfortunate espousal of the Iron Railing
Compromise, very obviously stood in the way of his
success. A day will, however, come around when, in
our judgment, the people will do justice to his pretension,
which we undertake to say is considerable."</p></div>

<p>From these extracts, the reader is already prepared
to exclaim with me, Oh, excellent Eliphalet Fox&mdash;mirror
of editors&mdash;pillar of the New-Light faith!
What exquisite address, what consummate skill hast
thou not evinced in these editorial effusions! Methinks
I see Eliphalet, a tide-waiter on events, watching the
ebb and flow of popular opinion; ever ready, at a
moment's warning, to launch his little boat of editorship
on the biggest wave, and upon that wave to ride
secure beyond the breakers, out upon the glassy ocean
of politics and then, after taking an observation of the
wind, to trim his sail with such nautical forecast as
shall make him sure to be borne along with the breeze
toward whatever haven it shall please the higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
powers to direct him; sagaciously counting in such
haven to find the richest return on his little stock
of ventures. I see his meager, attenuated, diminutive
person, elevated on a footstool six inches above the
floor, behind a high but somewhat rickety desk, in the
northwest corner of his lumber-filled office, where scissor-clipped
gazettes are strewed, elbow deep, over an
old walnut table, and where three dingy caricatures of
Harry Clay, Nic Biddle, and John C. Calhoun, are
tacked against his smoky walls; there I see him quiet,
but at work, with pen in hand, ever and anon darting
his cat-like eye at the door, upon each new-comer who
comes to tell the news of the canvass. I hear his
husky, dry, and querulous voice, tisicky and quick,
asking, how goes it in Bickerbray? What from Tumbledown?
and as he receives his answer <i>pro</i> or <i>con.</i>,
Fog or Flag, he turns to his half-scribbled sheet to
remould his paragraph, with the dexterity of an old
and practiced Quod, in such phrase as shall assuredly
earn him the good-will of the winner. Rare Eliphalet!
Admirable Fox! Incomparable servant of an
incomparable master!</p>

<p>It is with a sad and melancholy sincerity I record
the fact, that this election left behind it much heart-burning
in Quodlibet. The New-Light Democracy
were now broken into three parts, the Mandarins, the
Middlings, and the True Grits; and Theodore Fog, in
command of the True Grits, had evidently got the
upper hand. The defeat of Agamemnon Flag was a
severe blow to our distinguished representative, the
Hon. Middleton Flam, and no less galling to Nicodemus
Handy; for these three worthy gentlemen were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
undoubtedly at the head of the Mandarins, and their
overthrow on the present occasion led to unpleasant
consequences which I shall be called upon to notice
hereafter.</p>

<p>The first unhappy fruit of this election was of a
domestic nature, and wrought very seriously against
the peace of our friend Jesse Ferret.</p>

<p>For three days and nights after the publication of
the polls, all Quodlibet was alive with the rejoicings
of the True Grits at the success of Theodore Fog.
The bar-room of The Hero was full all day with these
energetic friends of the prosperous candidate; and it
is worthy of remark that their number was vastly
greater than was shown by the ballot box, many more
individuals claiming the honor of having voted for him
than the return of the polls would authorize us to
believe; all night long bonfires blazed, drums and fifes
disturbed the repose of the Borough, and processions,
not remarkable for their decorum, marched from house
to house with Theodore mounted in a chair, borne on
the shoulders of sturdy True Grits. A hundred torches
in the hands of thirty men and seventy boys, flared on
the signs and flickered on the walls of Quodlibet, and
fifty negroes, great and small, ragged and patched,
hatless and hatted, slip-shod and barefoot, leaped,
danced, limped, and hobbled in wide-spread concourse
around black Isaac the Kent bugle player, and yellow
Josh the clarionet man, who struck in with the drum
and fife to the tune of Jim Crow, about the center of
the column. Flan Sucker was installed grand marshal
of this procession, and was called <span class="smcap">King of the
True Grits</span>; while Ben Inky, Sim Travers, Jeff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Drinker, and More M'Nulty, served along the flanks
as his lieutenants; the whole array huzzaing at every
corner, and stopping to refresh every time they came
into the neighborhood of Peter Ounce's, Jesse Ferret's,
or the smaller ordinaries which the rapid growth of
Quodlibet had supplied in various quarters to relieve
the drought of its inhabitants.</p>

<p>This state of things, as I have said, continued for
three days after the election. At the end of that
period, Jesse Ferret, somewhere about noon, was in his
bar casting up his accounts. He wore a serious, disturbed
countenance&mdash;not because his accounts showed
a bad face; for so far from that, the late jubilee had
very considerably increased his capital in trade, but
because his rest had been broken&mdash;and Jesse never
could bear to lose his sleep. While he was engaged in
summing up these recent gains, his worthy spouse
entered the bar and quietly seated herself in a chair
behind him. The expression of her face showed that
her thoughts were occupied with matter of interesting
import: a slight frown sat upon her brow, her lips
were partially compressed, and her fat arms made an
attempt to cross each other on her bosom. The chair
was too small for her; and, from her peculiar configuration,
one looking at her in a full front view would
not be likely to conjecture she was seated, but rather
that she was a short and dumpy woman, and leaned
against some prop for rest&mdash;the line from her chin to
her toe being that of the face of a pyramid. Her
posture denoted an assumed patience. So quietly had
she entered the inclosure of the bar, that Jesse was
altogether ignorant of her presence, and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
continued at his occupation. It was not long, however,
before his attention was awakened to the interesting
fact that his wife was behind him, by the salutation,
conveyed in a rather deep-toned voice, "Jesse Ferret,
how long are you agoing to be poking over them accounts?"</p>

<p>Jesse turned short round, in some surprise at the
sound of these well-known accents so near him, and,
surveying the dame for an instant, replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bless me, Polly! how came you here? You go
about like one of them church-yard vaporations that
melts in thin air and frightens children in the dead of
night. What did you want with me, my love?"</p>

<p>"I want to know," said Mrs. Ferret, "who's master
of this house&mdash;you or me? Ef I'm the master, say so&mdash;but
ef you're the master, then act as sich. It ain't
no longer to be endured, this shilly-shally, visy-versy
politicks of yourn. Here you are casting up of the
accounts this blessed day, and please Heaven, if there's
one cent got into the till in the three days that have
gone by, the last person in the world to thank for it
is yourself, Jesse Ferret. Theodore Fog's <i>in</i>&mdash;got in
by a vote that one might say's almost magnanimous,
and he's got all the thirstiest men in this Borough
under his thumb&mdash;and he's been pouring 'em in here
in shoals, which he wouldn't have done, one man of
'em, ef it hadn't a been for my principles, which goes
the whole hog&mdash;and you so contrairy, constantly a
giving out your no sides&mdash;it's raly abominable! and
time you should change, Jesse Ferret, it is."</p>

<p>"Why, my dear, don't you see the good of it?" said
Mr. Ferret, in a mild, good-natured tone of expostula<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>tion.
"The very best thing we can do is for you to go
on as you are doing, and me to go on as I am. Here's
come up a great split in the party; and presently, as
sure as you are born, they'll be having their separate
houses and making party questions out of it: then, my
dear, you know Theodore Fog and his people counts
you as a sort of sun-dial to their side, and goes almost
by your pinting. And then the others, you know,
can't have nothing to find fault against me upon account
of my sentiments: so, in this way we shall get
the custom of the thorough-stitchers, the half-and-halfs,
the promiscuous, and of every kind of stripe that's
going. Can't you see into it, Mrs. Ferret?"</p>

<p>"No, I cannot see into it," replied the landlady.
"In the first place, them Mandarins, as The. Fog says,
is not worth the looking after in our line&mdash;they drink
nothing but Champagne and Madeery, and ef they do
sometimes send down to our bar for ourn, they are sure
to turn up their noses at it, and say it's sour. Didn't
Nicodemus Handy tell me to my face that my Anchor
Brand, which you've got on the top shelf, and which
cost you six dollars a basket at auction, was nothing
but turnip-juice?&mdash;and did you ever know Middleton
Flam to call for as much as a thimbleful of your
liquors, with all his preachings and parleyings in this
house? No, you did not: and it's your duty to cast
off your bucket o' both sides, and go in for The. with
the True Grits, as he calls them; and true enough
they are in the drinking line!&mdash;that, nobody who knows
them, will deny. I'm tired, Jesse Ferret, and fretted
down to the very bone, at being put upon in this here
way, having to keep up the politicks of this house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
which I don't think you haint no right to do, I don't.
I'm been a talking to you about this tell I'm tired, and
I wonder you can be so obstinate, considering I take it
so much to heart."</p>

<p>"Now, Polly," interposed our landlord with an
affectionate remonstrance, intended to soothe Mrs.
Ferret's feelings, "many's the struggle I've had on
this here very topic with my own conscience; I may
say I have wrestled for it at the very bottom of my
nature. But the case is this, and I'll explain it to you
once for all. I've got a sentiment at the core of my
heart, which is a secret in regard of these here politicks.
I wish to go right&mdash;you know I do&mdash;but if I
only knowed what sentiments <i>to</i> take up:&mdash;there's the
mystery. If I knowed <i>that</i>, I should feel easy; but I
never could keep any principles, upon account of the
changes. Before a plain, simple man can cleverly tell
where he is, everything has whisked away in the contrairy
direction. One year we are 'all tariff,' and the
next, 'down with it as an abomination.' Here we go
'for canals and railroads!'&mdash;a crack of the whip, and
there we are all t'other side. 'No electioneering
of officers!' cries out the captain of the squad. 'Turn
that fellow out, he don't work for the party!' cries the
very same captain in the very next breath. 'Retrenchment
and reform!' says every big fellow there at
Washington; and the same words are bawled all the
way down among us, even to Theodore Fog;&mdash;'Damn
the expense!' (the Lord forgive me for using such
words,) says the very same fellows in the same breath,
'stick on a million here and a million there&mdash;the more
the merrier!' And so we go. Here, t'other day, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
here Sub-Treasury was monarchy and revolution to
boot, and treason outright; and now, what it <i>is</i>, every
man's afeard to say&mdash;some's for, some's against&mdash;some's
both, and all's in a state of amalgamation,
perplexity, and caterwauling unaccountable. What
between specy circlars, anti-masons, pocketing of bills,
(Lord knows what that means!) vetoes, distribution,
fortifications, abolition, running down Indians, and
running up accounts, politics has got into a jumble
that a Philadelphy lawyer couldn't steer through them.
A poor publican has a straining time of it, Polly. He
can't get right if he tries&mdash;and if he does blunder
upon it, he can't <i>stay</i> right six months, let him do his
best&mdash;morally impossible! That's where it's a matter
o' conscience with me; and my conclusion is, in such a
mucilaginous state of affairs, a man who wants to accommodate
the public must be either all sides or no
sides; and, therefore I say, my motto is, a publican
should&mdash;leastways I speak in regard to these times&mdash;have
no sides. And there's the whole matter laid out
to you, Polly, my wife."</p>

<p>"All sides, any day, before No sides!" replied Mrs.
Ferret. "As Susan Barndollar says, stick to your
colors and they'll carry you to sides a plenty, I'll warrant
you. Don't Theodore Fog tell us the Democracy's
a trying of experiments&mdash;and, Lord bless us!
ef they haint carried you on sides enough, then you
<i>are</i> an unreasonable man. Principle isn't principle&mdash;it's
following of your party:&mdash;you change when <i>it</i>
changes, whereby you are always right. Now, these
here True Grits is two to one to the Mandarins and
Middlings both, and they devour, yes, ten times as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
much liquor. Ef you had an eye in your head, you'd
come out a True Grit&mdash;it's a naiteral tavern-keeper's
politics."</p>

<p>"'Spose, my dear," said Jesse, waxing warm, "things
takes a turn off hand. 'Spose these True Grits are upset&mdash;as
I shouldn't wonder they would be, as soon as
Middleton Flam comes home from Congress, and winds
up the people right again&mdash;as he has often done before&mdash;am
I going to run my head against a post by
offending the whole New-Light Club, which meets at
our house, and make enemies by having sentiments
of my own? You don't know me, Polly Ferret."</p>

<p>"Well, and ef things does take a turn?" replied the
wife, "is there anythink new in that, in this Borough?
Haint we had turns before? Theodore Fog will turn
with 'em&mdash;that's his principle&mdash;that's my principle,
and it ought, by rights, to be yourn. Doesn't the
schoolmaster tell you to stick to the upper side?
Doesn't our member, Middleton Flam, tell you the
same thing, and Nicodemus Handy, and Liphlet Fox?
There's your own barkeeper, Nim Porter, that's
asleep in yander winder, who's got more sense than
you have; he knows what side his bread's buttered&mdash;and
even your own child, Susan Barndollar, though
she stuck out for the nomination, isn't such a ninny as
to have no principles. We're Dimmycrats, and always
counts with the majority; and that's safe whichever
way it goes; and, as I said before, no mortal man can
find out a better side than that for a tavern-keeper.
But it's the Whigs your're a courting, Jesse Ferret&mdash;the
Whigs, neither more nor less&mdash;and it's pitiful in
you to be so sneaking."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Polly, if you aint got no better language than
that to use to me," exclaimed Ferret, under considerable
excitement, "I'd advise you to hold your
tongue."</p>

<p>"My tongue's my own, Mr. Ferret," replied the
landlady, "and I don't want none of your advice what
I'm to do with it. I have used it long enough to
know how to keep it a running, and how to stop it,
without being taught by you."</p>

<p>"I've got no right to listen to you, if I don't
choose," retorted the landlord. "Women has their
milking and churning to look after, and, to my thinking,
they'd best attend to that, instead of skreiking
out politics in public bar-rooms&mdash;that's my opinion,
Mrs. Ferret."</p>

<p>"Women, indeed!&mdash;for <i>you</i> to talk about women!&mdash;You're
the laughing-stock of all the petticoats of our
Borough," said the wife, in a high key of exacerbation.
"Mrs. Younghusband, and Mrs. Snuffers, and Mrs.
Doubleday makes you a continual banter, and it
hurts my feelings as the mother of your children, it
does."</p>

<p>"Seize Mrs. Younghusband, and Mrs. Snuffers, and
Mrs. Doubleday, all three!" exclaimed Ferret in a
sort of demi-oath.</p>

<p>"What's that you said, Mr. Ferret?"</p>

<p>"I said seize 'em! and I don't care the rinsings
of that glass if you tell 'em so,&mdash;a set of mandrakes."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jesse Ferret, Jesse Ferret,&mdash;as a man who
sets up to be an example, what are you coming to!"
exclaimed the landlady, with uplifted hands. "Ef your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
children could hear such profanity. I declare to patience,
you'd try the quarters of the meekest mother
in the universe."</p>

<p>How far this conjugal outflash might have gone in
its natural course, it is impossible for me to say;
although Nim Porter, who pretended to be asleep all
the time, and who heard every word of it, and related
it with much pleasantry to me, says he has often witnessed
these breezes between this worthy couple, and
always found that they made up as soon as Mrs. Ferret
got out of breath&mdash;which, by-the-by, she being short-winded,
generally occurred in about half an hour from
the first rising of her anger; but, on the present occasion,
it was happily interrupted by the entrance of
Theodore Fog, Dabbs, the foreman in Eliphalet Fox's
printing-office, Flan Sucker, More M'Nulty, and Sim
Travers, who all marched directly up to the bar. I
had entered upon the heels of this party, and having
taken up "The Whole Hog" for my perusal, in one
corner of the room, was myself a witness to the scene
that followed.</p>

<p>Nim Porter, who was seated in an elbow-chair,
resting the back of his head against a window-sill
at the opposite end of the bar-room and counterfeiting
sleep, was now roused up to attend to the
customers.</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs. Ferret&mdash;paragon of landladies,"
said Fog, "Pillar&mdash;yes, bolster of our cause&mdash;some
drink! Dabbs owes a treat, and we have resolved that
the libation shall be made under the eye of our own
queen. Dabbs, say what the mixture shall be; I'm
not particular&mdash;my throat is a turnpike traveled by all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
imaginable potations. A mint julep, Dabbs? gentlemen!
Flan, a julep? Yes? A julep, a julep all
round. Agreed to, nem. con. Mrs. Ferret, five juleps;
charge Dabbs&mdash;Dabbs's treat."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ferret's anger against her spouse gradually
faded under this accost; a slight glimpse of sunshine
began to break over her visage as she addressed herself
to the task of preparing the required compounds,
and Nim Porter busied himself in picking sprigs of
mint from a large bouquet of that invaluable plant,
which flourished in native verdure over the rim of a
two quart tumbler, in which it seemed to grow as in a
flower-pot.</p>

<p>Ferret had retreated from the bar toward the door
which looked upon the street; and Theodore Fog, who,
as the truth must be spoken, was at this hour very
considerably advanced toward his customary zenith of
excitement, thrust his hands under the skirts of his
striped gingham coatee, and strutted with the air of
a prime minister in a farce, around the room.</p>

<p>"Nim," said he,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"'Bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,<br /></div>
<div class="line">She strike upon the bell.'</div>
</div></div>

<p>Ferret&mdash;glorious turn out, Ferret. True Grits all
alive. Pound that ice fine, Nim&mdash;no water, recollect.
First-rate fellows, Ferret&mdash;go the whole&mdash;real Quods&mdash;diamonds."</p>

<p>"Hope you'll mend matters now, Mr. Fog, since
you've got in," said Ferret. "I'm for giving every one
a chance; wish you success."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course you do, Ferret," replied Fog; "and so
you would have wished Ag Flag success if he'd
got in."</p>

<p>"Or Andy Grant, either," said Mrs. Ferret; "my
husband's not partikler."</p>

<p>"You're right, Ferret&mdash;you're right!" interrupted
Fog, "always go with the current&mdash;that's sound philosophy&mdash;that's
my rule. Dabbs, isn't that metaphysics?
Flan, don't you call that the true theory
of the balance of power? Gentlemen, I submit it to
you all."</p>

<p>"Real True-Grit doctrine," said Flan; "find out
how the cat jumps&mdash;then go ahead."</p>

<p>"Fundamental, that," said Dabbs; "principles
change, measures vary, names rise and fall, but majority
is always majority."</p>

<p>"Bravo, Dabbs!" ejaculated Theodore Fog; "<i>Tempora
mutantur et nos mutamur cum illis</i>&mdash;that's our
True-Grit motto. The nominative case always agrees
with the verb; the people are the verb, we're the
nominative case. That's logic, Mrs. Ferret. Nim,
how have you made out in these illustrious 'three
days?'"</p>

<p>"Cursed sleepy," answered Nim Porter, who was
now brewing the drink by pouring it from one tumbler
to another; "haven't had three hours rest in the whole
three nights. No right to complain though&mdash;won four
bets&mdash;had two to one against Andy Grant with Tompkinson&mdash;and
even against Ag with three of the New-Light
Club. I knew d&mdash;d well how it was going, ever
since the meeting at the Sycamore Spring. Fog, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
touched them fellows that work on the Bickerbray and
Meltpenny Road 'twixt wind and water."</p>

<p>"Didn't I?" exclaimed Fog; "I opine I did; unequivocally,
I fancy I did. I venture to add, with all
possible energy of asseveration, that I did that thing,
Nim. That's what I call walking into the understanding
of the independent, electoral constituent
body; and the best of it is, we got them their votes,
you dog!"</p>

<p>"You didn't lose no votes that I could bring you,"
said Mrs. Ferret, "although you didn't get Jesse's.
But that wa'n't much loss&mdash;for Jesse's of little account
anyhow, and hasn't the influence of a chicken in
this Borough&mdash;as no man hasn't, whose afeard of his
shadow."</p>

<p>"Well, we don't want to hear no more about that,"
interrupted the landlord. "Mr. Fog knows it wasn't
ill will to him&mdash;but only my principle, that publicans
had best not take sides."</p>

<p>"And who has a right to object to that?" exclaimed
Fog. "Give us your hand, Jesse&mdash;I'd do the same
thing myself, if I were in your place."</p>

<p>"Well, ef you aint the forgivingest creature, Mr.
Fog!" said the landlady.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ferret, your health!&mdash;gentlemen, take your
respective glasses&mdash;Dabbs, your health&mdash;Jesse&mdash;Flan&mdash;all
of you&mdash;Success to the True Grits! Top off,
boys."</p>

<p>They all drank.</p>

<p>Fog applied the tumbler to his lips; looked straight
forward, with what might be called a fixed stare upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
vacancy, his eyes expressing the deep emotion of sensual
pleasure which the icy compound inspired as it
slowly flowed over his palate, and for a full minute
employed himself without pause in draining the contents
of his glass&mdash;gradually and slowly arching
back his head until the last drop trickled from the
bottom.</p>

<p>"Amazing seductive beverage, Mrs. Ferret!" he
said as he smacked his lips, and set the tumbler down
upon the board. "Fascinating potation! If I were
not an example of consummate prudence, and the
most circumspect being not yet gathered within the
pale of the Temperance Society, my virtue would have
fallen a victim before this to that enticing cordial, Mrs.
Ferret. But I'm proof&mdash;I have been sorely tried, and
have come out of the furnace, as you see me, superior
to the temptations of this wicked world. Dabbs, poney
up&mdash;we must go to the raffle, which begins in five
minutes at Rhody M'Caw's stable&mdash;that pacing roan,
Nim&mdash;you'll be there, of course:&mdash;in your line. Come,
gentlemen&mdash;don't wipe your mouths with your sleeves&mdash;let
the odor exhale. As some poet somewhere says,
speaking of a mint julep,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">'Sweet vale of Ovoca, how calm could I rest,&mdash;<br /></div>
<div class="line i2">If there's a drink upon earth<br /></div>
<div class="line i4">It is this&mdash;it is this.'</div>
</div></div>

<p>Not the words exactly&mdash;but something in that run.
Jesse, the Flower of Quodlibet&mdash;Mrs. Ferret, Queen
of the Spear Mint&mdash;good-by. Nim, you rascal&mdash;after
the raffle is over, expect to see me as dry as an
oven."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>When Fog had delivered himself of this rhapsody&mdash;which,
no doubt, has impressed the reader with the
conviction that this noontide glass had done its work
upon the brain of our new representative in the Legislature&mdash;the
whole party made their exit; and Jesse
Ferret, anxious to avoid another conference with his
dame, professing a wish to witness the raffle, followed
in their footsteps.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

TERMINATION OF IT&mdash;NIM PORTER'S INDISCRETION.</p>

<p class="p2">The design of this little book forbids that I should
do more than cursorily touch upon many incidents in
the history of Quodlibet, which, although abundant of
interest to the curious reader, are not so immediately
connected with the main purpose of this work&mdash;that
purpose being to unfold the operation of the great
principle of the New-Light Quodlibetarian theory.</p>

<p>Whenever the time shall arrive, as I would fain persuade
myself it must, in which the public shall feel
such concern in the affairs of Quodlibet as to demand
of me a full disclosure of the treasures of my MSS., I
shall greatly delight in spreading before it many particulars
which I have collected, having reference to the
private concernments and domestic transactions of our
people and their sundry ways in regard to many matters
which do not fall within the scope of my present
undertaking. For, truly, the history of Quodlibet will
be found, when impartially narrated, to yield a plenti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>ful
fruitage of ethical, moral and social instruction, as
well as political&mdash;to which latter aspect are my labors
at this time confined.</p>

<p>In conformity with my plan, and being desirous to
hasten forward to a more modern epoch in these annals,
I pass over the intervening space, and bring my reader
almost a year in advance of the events narrated in the
last chapter.</p>

<p>It was now approaching the fifth year of the Removal:&mdash;the
long session of Congress had closed in
July, 1838. The Hon. Middleton Flam had once more
returned to his constituents, and temporarily mingled
in the walks of private life. Greatly was his return
desiderated at this epoch. We had got all wrong&mdash;we
lacked information&mdash;we wanted this great man's
advice.</p>

<p>The split at this time&mdash;if I may use a metaphor&mdash;was
green and wide; or, in plainer language, our dissensions
ran high. If the men might be said to be at
sixes and sevens, the women were twice as bad&mdash;they
were at twelves and fourteens. Mrs. Ferret had become
inveterate, and headed a party of Feminine True
Grits; Susan Barndollar, who had a temper of her
own, of course became inveterate too, and, as Barndollar
&amp; Hardbottle were accounted a rich firm, she
headed, or strove to do so, a party of Feminine Mandarins.
Hester Hardbottle, under a similar impulse,
took command of the Female Middlings. Thus marshaled,
the New-Light women manifested a very high
degree of political corruscation, and kept the Borough
in perpetual hot water. Every tea-party was a scalding
concern, and it was lamentable to see what a foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>hold
the serpent of discord had gained in our little
Eden of Quodlibet.</p>

<p>The men were not so ferocious; in part because they
had their business to look after; but chiefly, because
the stronger, when they failed in argument, could drub
the weaker&mdash;and that drubbing system is a great
moderator of political opinions. The women, having
neither of these motives to keep quiet, took the bits in
their mouths and ran off as fast as, and whenever, they
chose.</p>

<p>Theodore Fog's conduct in the Legislature, during
the past winter, had in some degree rather weakened
the cause of his friends. He had disappointed them&mdash;although
they were unwilling publicly to allow as much&mdash;on
two points: First, because he had not got them
all provided with offices, as he had, it appeared, secretly
promised; but, on the contrary, came home without
having accomplished that desirable object for a single
individual of the party; and, secondly, because he had
been exceedingly irregular in his habits during the
whole session, and had consequently made but four
speeches, of three hours each, during the winter, when
it was confidently expected that he would have made
at least thirty-four, and have completely silenced the
opposition. The irregularity of his habits they could
forgive; but the matter of the offices sunk deep in
their hearts&mdash;they began to suspect his Democracy.</p>

<p>A change had also taken place in the business affairs
of Quodlibet. All improvements had ceased:&mdash;many
persons were out of employment; industry was declining;
trade was at a low ebb; the mechanics were
grumbling, and four mercantile houses had failed. Im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>mediately
after the suspension Nicodemus Handy had
issued a great amount of small notes. Dr. Thomas G.
Winkelman, actuated by patriotic emotions, also issued
a batch payable in soda-water, soap, or physic. Zachary
Younghusband, the tinplate-worker and postmaster,
reflecting on the crisis, and being determined to contribute
his mite toward the regulation of the currency,
followed the example of Dr. Winkelman, and put out a
ream, redeemable in Copperplate Bank notes when
presented to the amount of five dollars at his tinplate
shop. Sim Travers, who had a drinking shed at the
lower end of the canal basin, with equal public spirit,
uttered his paper in fips, "Good for a Drink." Many
others imitated these precedents, whereby it fell out
that no part of the Union was better supplied with a
currency than Quodlibet.</p>

<p>Still the Borough languished and pined under a
gradual decay of its prosperity; and it was long before
our wise men could ascertain the real source of this
decline. The cause was at last discovered. We are
indebted for its development to the astuteness of our
distinguished representative. There were eight of the
principal mercantile houses of the Borough which had
been established by Whigs: in fact, throwing out
Barndollar &amp; Hardbottle, all the merchants of Quodlibet
might be said to be opposed to the administration.
It was very apparent, after the Hon. Middleton Flam
drew the attention of the club to this fact, that these
houses had combined to produce an utter prostration
of business, solely for political effect, and that the
malevolence of four of the most thriving among them
had gone so far as even to render themselves bankrupt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
and to break up, for no earthly purpose but that of
making the administration unpopular. "This is a
specimen of the gratitude," said Mr. Flam, speaking
with great emotion upon the subject, "this is the
gratitude of these commercial vultures&mdash;(he always
called them commercial vultures after the Suspension,
and when speaking to the people)&mdash;for all the manifold
favors and bounties which, for five years past, the
government has been so assiduously heaping upon their
heads. This is their acknowledgment of the extraordinary
kindness shown them by the Secretary of the
Treasury when he directed our bank to lend these
vipers the public money! Biddle and the Barings are
at the bottom of this conspiracy; and the merchants
of the United States, yes, and the manufacturers and
all the moneyed men, would gladly beggar themselves
and their families rather than allow us to regulate
their currency and make them the happiest people on
earth. What unparalleled perfidy!"</p>

<p>After this, the New Lights of course became indignant
against the merchants, and held them up, as they
deserved, to public execration, as the authors of all our
misfortunes. From Quodlibet, this sentiment became
general among the New-Light Democrats everywhere.
Mr. Van Buren caught the idea; the Globe expatiated
upon it; the Stump rang with it; and it soon took its
place as one of the cardinal maxims in the New-Light
creed. Such is the supremacy of one commanding
intellect!</p>

<p>Never was there a topic equal to this in the elections.
"The merchants," Theodore Fog very pertinently
remarked, "are a first-rate subject for a stump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
speech: they are a monstrous <i>little</i> knot of fellows,
anyhow&mdash;and, comparatively speaking, of no sort of
account, in the way of voting. Having the handling
of a good deal of cash, and plenty to do in the way of
giving and taking of promissory notes, you can slap
upon them the argument of The Money Power with
tremendous effect: you can tickle them with the whip
of Aristocracy in perfection; and you can run 'em down
with the text of the money-changers in the Temple, and
all that sort of thing, to a nicety. Besides, there are
so few of them that either <i>can</i> make a speech before
the people, or, if they can, will take the trouble to
follow a man about for that purpose, that you are not
likely to be pestered with their replies. Capital animals
for <i>an opposition</i>, they take a lathering so quiet!
Then, sir, for every <i>one</i> merchant you lay upon his
back, you gain <i>five</i> True Grits to your side. I've
studied that out. Our people, I mean the New Lights,
can be made to hate a merchant like snakes&mdash;because
if he does get on well with his business, and makes a
little fortune, we can call him a Rag Baron, a Ruffle
Shirt, a Scrub Aristocrat,&mdash;and that's equal to sending
him to the deserts of Arabia: and if he fails, as the
greater part of the poor devils do, we can get up a
still worse cry against him for turning the humble and
honest laborer out of employment, grinding the faces
of the poor, depriving the widow and the orphan of
their bread, and coining the sweat of the Bone and
Sinew's brow to feed Usurers, Brokers, and Shavers.
And, by-the-by, these arguments are quite good against
manufacturers and Whig master-mechanics. But a
merchant, sir, can't hold up his head one moment before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
them. Every which way, sir, he's a prime scape-goat.
Then, sir, when we want to make an <span class="smcap lowercase">EXPERIMENT</span>,&mdash;why,
of course, we go to the merchants. Here's all
this <i>currency</i> business, especially the tail of it, the Sub-Treasury&mdash;fine
thing to stir up the people with&mdash;sounds
well in theory, though a little mischievous in practice.
Well, sir, we test it on the merchants: <i>we</i> get the
popularity, <i>they</i> get the damage. The approved philosophical
mode to try a dangerous experiment, is to
attempt it on a cat:&mdash;sir, <i>The Merchants are our cats</i>."</p>

<p>Mr. Flam, seeing the state of our divisions, took a
great deal of trouble to restore harmony into our
ranks, and certainly did much to overawe the True
Grits, who, now fancying themselves in the ascendent,
became very dictatorial. Eliphalet Fox, although he
took every occasion to speak in his paper greatly in
commendation of Mr. Flam, was, nevertheless, an active
upholder of the True-Grit division. "Our worthy
representative," he said, "was happily stationed above
the influence of these little <i>family quarrels</i>; and it
was undoubtedly a subject of congratulation with that
distinguished gentleman, that every section of the great
Democratic household of Quodlibet could cordially
unite the testimonials of their confidence in his talents,
his patriotism, and his fidelity to the interests of his
constituents."</p>

<p>This paragraph was considered a master-stroke of
New-Light Democracy in Eliphalet, because its tendency
was to keep him and his paper on good terms
with all parties supporting the administration, while it
left him free to pursue the paramount objects which
the True Grits steadily kept in view.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>These objects were the attainment of all the lucrative
offices in our district,&mdash;a striking exemplification
of which now occurred in the celebrated Tigertail
affair. That affair my duty as a chronicler requires
me to notice.</p>

<p>A secret meeting of the True Grits had been lately
held in the Borough. The subject in discussion was a
weighty one. It was reported to this conclave that
Ferox Tigertail, the marshal of this district, who resided
and kept his office in Bickerbray, had in his employment
two individuals of suspicious principles. The
first was Washington Cutbush, a clerk, who had been
overheard to say, at the Sycamore Spring, in a confidential
conversation with his brother-in-law, Lemuel
Garret, that he began to think Tom Benton's gold
currency a <span class="smcap lowercase">HUMBUG</span>! The second was Corney Dust,
the porter and firemaker of the office, who, there was
reason to believe, had voted at the last election for
Agamemnon Flag. Upon these facts being vouched
to the meeting by Magnus Morehead, the True Grit
shoemaker in the Borough, and Sandy Buttercrop, the
express-rider, message-carrier, baggage-porter, and
follower of sundry other visible means of livelihood, it
was resolved that a committee of three, to consist of
Eliphalet Fox, Dr. Winkelman, and Nim Porter, should
wait upon Mr. Tigertail, communicate to him the full
extent of the charge, and require him, in the name of
The Exclusive, New-Light, True-Grit Democrats of
Quodlibet, forthwith to dismiss Washington Cutbush
from his office, and substitute Magnus Morehead in his
place; and also to supersede Corney Dust by the appointment
of Sandy Buttercrop.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>The committee, in pursuance of these instructions,
visited the marshal, and explained the object of their
mission in respectful but firm language. Tigertail,
being a choleric man, and an old Federalist to boot,&mdash;who
had been converted to the New-Light faith about
eight years ago, at the date of the renewal of his commission,&mdash;heard
the committee with exemplary composure;
and then setting his eyes, with a fixed glare,
upon Eliphalet Fox, he waited about ten seconds&mdash;at
the end of which brief period of deliberation, he kicked
the said Eliphalet clean out of his office:&mdash;and this
being done to his entire satisfaction, he rather testily
invited Dr. Winkelman and Nim Porter to follow their
chairman. It is due to these two gentlemen to say,
that like good committee men, they did so,&mdash;even
anticipating the marshal's invitation to the adoption
of that course of conduct.</p>

<p>This incident being faithfully reported by the committee
to the meeting of True Grits, convened for the
express purpose of learning the result, it was unanimously
resolved,&mdash;First, that Tigertail's demeanor was
mysterious, equivocal, and unexpected; secondly, that
it was unpolite to Eliphalet Fox; and, thirdly, that it
was against the principles and usages known to the
New-Light Democracy. Another resolution was adopted
to lay the whole matter before the President of the
United States, and to instruct him, as the Representative
of the People, to dismiss Marshal Tigertail, without
delay, from his post; and confer it upon the injured
Eliphalet Fox, whose kicking entitled him to the deepest
sympathy of the party, and gave him, according to a
well-established maxim of the New Lights, a right to
immediate preferment.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>These resolutions imparted great satisfaction to the
meeting, and no doubt was entertained that the President
would act upon the subject with that promptitude
which distinguishes his character. Marshal Tigertail
was looked upon as a doomed man, and no better than
a Whig; and indeed he was already considered as
having joined that party. Dr. Thomas G. Winkelman,
Nim Porter, and Dabbs, the compositor, were intrusted
with this embassy of instruction to the President;&mdash;Eliphalet
Fox being left out of the deputation from
obvious considerations of delicacy&mdash;a sentiment which
it must be allowed has ever characterized the proceedings
of the True Grits on all occasions, and which
many of the most observant and sagacious of that sect
have asserted has been the principal cause of the failure
of their schemes.</p>

<p>The new deputation lost no time in setting forth
upon the execution of their duty. They were attended
to the stage coach by a large number of True Grits,
who, to use the language of Theodore Fog, "signalized
their departure with indignant pomp." Great expectations
were indulged on this appeal, or rather this
mandate to the President. Day after day passed by
without bringing news from the mission:&mdash;the Globe
was taken from each mail with increased avidity, in the
hope of seeing some official announcement of the removal
of Tigertail. A provoking silence on that point
reigned throughout its columns. Ten days rolled on
without a letter from the committee:&mdash;a fortnight wore
away, and yet none had returned. A traveler at last
reported that he had seen Nim Porter at the White
Sulphur Springs. It was ascertained that Dr. Winkelman
was in the City of New York purchasing drugs for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
his shop; and upon investigation it was discovered that
Dabbs had been at his work in the printing-office, unknown
to the Borough, for more than a week. By a
singular coincidence of feeling among the True Grits,
all curiosity as to the fate of the mission suddenly
subsided. The subject was treated with indifference;
and in the course of a few days, after both Dr. Winkelman
and Nim Porter had returned home, when the
Thorough Blue Whole Team put forth a paragraph inquiring
after the Tigertail Embassy, the Whole Hog
came out with a petulant and snappish reply, affirming
that the report of such a mission was a mere Whig lie,
coined with a view to political effect, and uttered in the
Whole Team simply because "that mendacious and
filthy sheet delighted to revel in falsehood, and had
never been known to stumble upon the truth, even by
accident." Dr. Winkelman studiously avoided all
reference to his absence from the Borough, and Nim
Porter was equally cautious for about a month; at the
expiration of which period Neal Hopper happened to
say, in his presence, he had good reason to know that
Marshal Tigertail was no favorite with the President,
and would be removed from office before the end of the
next Congress;&mdash;whereupon Nim, very unguardedly and
under a sudden, uncontrollable impulse, planted himself
before the miller and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'll bet you one hundred dollars to ten upon that."</p>

<p>"Well, I 'spose you know?" said Neal, struck by
Nim's peremptory manner.</p>

<p>"Conclusively and distinctly," replied Nim with
some heat. "If you think Liphalet Fox is going to be
the marshal you're mistaken: I know Martin Van<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Buren," he added with some display of self-importance,
"considerably&mdash;and I can tell you that he goes the
whole figure against rotation in this individual and
identical case. He's a Mandarin from snout to tail&mdash;trained
up from the gum, and wouldn't touch a True
Grit with a forty-foot pole. Martin has defined his
position emphatically. There can't be a possibility of
mistake upon the subject."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that you heard him say so?"
inquired William Goodlack, the tailor, a strenuous
member of the True Grits, looking angrily at Nim.</p>

<p>"That's neither here nor there," replied Nim. "But
I'll stand to the bet of one hundred dollars to ten, that
Tigertail's not turned out of office this year: you are
welcome to take it yourself, Billy Goodlack, if you're
a mind for a bet."</p>

<p>"Whoever said Tigertail ought to be turned out?"
asked Goodlack, peevishly, "'cepting Neal Hopper,
who picked up such a story out of the nine thousand
lies of the Whole Team?"</p>

<p>From this little brush with Nim Porter, and from
the looks that passed between the parties engaged in
it, there was room for the inference that the President
didn't give much encouragement to the committee who
went to him with instructions to turn out the marshal:
and this is nearly everything that has ever transpired
in Quodlibet upon that subject. It is very certain that,
for some time after this date, the True Grits were not
so bold as a party as they had been before. Eliphalet
Fox was undoubtedly much chop-fallen during all the
following winter.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p class="chapt-summary smaller">A POLITICAL DISCUSSION AT ABEL BRAWN'S SHOP&mdash;ABEL'S VIEWS OF
THE SUB-TREASURY&mdash;IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION MADE BY THEODORE
FOG&mdash;THE NEW LIGHTS TAKE GROUND AGAINST THE BANKS&mdash;THE
HON. MIDDLETON FLAM RESIGNS THE PRESIDENCY OF THE
COPPERPLATE BANK&mdash;SNUFFERS ASPIRES TO THE SUCCESSION.</p>

<p class="p2">Toward the latter end of August, in the year referred
to in the last chapter, about five o'clock in the
afternoon, a much larger collection than usual of work
horses were seen around Abel Brawn's shop, waiting to
be shod. The shop stands a few rods below Christy
M'Curdy's mill, and immediately upon the bank of the
Rumblebottom. The mill is just outside of the compactly-built
portion of the Borough; and from the door,
Neal Hopper, the miller, could see along the road, on
his left hand, into the principal cross street of Quodlibet,
and on his right, directly into Abel Brawn's smith-shop.
This advantage of position was much prized by
Neal, because it enabled him to observe everybody
going either from the town-side or the country-side to
the blacksmith's. And as the shop was a famous
ground for political discussion and newsmongering;
and as Neal had an insaturable stomach (insaturabile
abdomen) for that sort of gossip, a glance from the
mill door gave him the means of knowing who was
either at or on the way to the shop. Then, if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
company suited him, he was in the habit of confiding
the temporary government of the mill to a mealy-headed
negro called Cicero, who could turn out a grist
as well as himself, and so allow himself the chance of a
brush at argument with Abel Brawn's customers.</p>

<p>On this evening in August, as I said, there were more
horses than usual at the smithy. Six or seven men
were lounging about the door or in the shop, talking
very loud, with every now and then a word from Abel,
who was busily employed alternately hammering out
shoes on the anvil, and fitting them to the horses' feet;
while squinting Billy Spike, a rather ungainly lad, an
apprentice to the smith, was keeping off the flies with a
horsetail fastened to the end of a stick. I had been
taking a walk that evening with some of my boys to
look at the ruins of the old school-house, and, seeing
this little gathering about Abel Brawn's, I stopped to
hear what was going on. Being somewhat fatigued by
my exercitation, I sat down on the bench under the
shed, having sent my boys home by themselves, and
remained here a quiet though not an inattentive spectator
of the scene before me. It is by cultivating such
opportunities that I have been enabled to impart that
interest to these pages which, without vanity, I may
say my reader cannot fail to discover in them. Such
have ever been my choicest and most profitable moments
of observation&mdash;subseciva qudam tempora, qu
ego perire non patiar.</p>

<p>Neal Hopper was engaged in repairing a bolting-cloth
up stairs in the mill, and, for some time after this
assemblage had gathered about the smith's shop, did
not hear or seem to know what was going forward, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
there came a loud, sharp laugh and a whoop which
aroused his attention. As soon as he heard this, he
pricked up his ears, listened a moment, and upon a
repetition of the laugh, stepped to the window, looked
down toward the shop and saw who were there, then
called Cicero to finish the repair of the bolting-cloth&mdash;and
went straight to the blacksmith's.</p>

<p>"Well, what's the fraction," said Neal, "that you're
all a busting out in such a spell of a laugh about?"</p>

<p>Hearing Neal's voice, Abel Brawn put down the
horse's foot which he was then shoeing, from his lap,
and standing upright, replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"There seems to be a sort of a snarl here among
these brother Democrats of yours, concerning of this
here Sub-Treasury. Some of them say it's against the
banks, and some of them say it's for the banks. They
have got it that Cambreling should have give out in
Congress that it was going to help the banks and keep
them up; and others, on the contrary, say that Old
Tom Benton swears that it won't leave so much as the
skin of a corporated company 'twixt Down East and
the Mississippi. And they say, moreover, that little
Martin lays dark about it."</p>

<p>"What does the Globe give out concerning of it?"
inquired Neal.</p>

<p>"Well, the Globe," replied Sam Pivot, the assessor
of our county, who was out for sheriff, and who was
very cautious in all his opinions, "is, as I take it, a
little dubious. Sometimes he makes this Sub-Treasury
a smasher to all banks; and then again he fetches it
up as a sort of staff to prop the good ones and to
knock down the cripples. Last fall, just before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
New York election, he rather buttered the banks, seeing
that the Democracy in that quarter hadn't made
up their minds to run as strong against the laboring
people as they are willing to do over here in the South.
But in April, when the Virginny elections was up, he
was as savage as a meat-ax;&mdash;and I rather expect,
from what I see in the President's message, that it
isn't yet fairly understood whether the Sub-Treasury
is to kill or cure the banking system."</p>

<p>"It's a pig in a poke, to make the best of it," said
Abel Brawn; "and is flung before the people now because
Van hasn't got nothing better to offer us, and
not because he values it above an old shoe. To my
thinking, when the people have decided against a law,
as they have done now against this Sub-Treasury, as
you call it, twice in Congress, a President of the
United States ought to have that respect for the will
of the people to let it drop. That's what I call Whig
Democracy&mdash;though it mayn't be yourn."</p>

<p>"Never!" exclaimed Tom Crop, the constable of our
Borough. "If the people go agin the Dimocracy, the
Dimocracy ought to put them down. We go for principle;
and it's our business to try it over and over
again, until we carry it. Truth is mighty and <i>will</i>
prevail, as the old Gineral says."</p>

<p>"I have never been able," said Neal Hopper,
"rightly to make out what this Sub-Treasury is, anyhow.
If any man knows, let him tell me."</p>

<p>"What does that signify?" answered Crop. "Some
calls it a divorce&mdash;but betwixt who I don't know, and
what's more, I don't care. It's for the poor man we
are a fighting, against the rich. The Whigs are for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
making the poor poorer, and the rich richer&mdash;and I
say any man who goes against the Sub-Treasury, can't
have no respect for Dimmicratic principles."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it is," said Abel Brawn; "ever
since the old Federals took hold of General Jackson's
skirts, and joined him in breaking down the banks,
they have been plotting to keep their heads above
water&mdash;and so they set about making experiments
right and left, to see if they couldn't hit upon something
new to please the people. But, bless you&mdash;they
don't know no more about the people than they do
about making horseshoes; and that's the reason why
they have been such bunglers in all their works: and
the end has been to bring us into such a pickle as no
country ever was in before. They have teetotally
ruinated everything they have laid their hands on&mdash;and
now they come out and say 'the people expect too
much from the Government,' and by way of making
that saying good, they have got up this Sub-Treasury,
which is nothing more nor less than a contrivance to
get all the money of the country into their own strong
box, knowing that when they have <i>the money</i>, they
have got <i>the power</i>, for as long as they please. That's
an old Federal trick, which they understand as well as
any men in the world. Now the people, who see into
this scheme, don't like it, and so they vote it down in
Congress. Well, what does these Federals do then?
Submit? No&mdash;to be sure not&mdash;that's not their principle.
They go at it again; set to drilling of Congress,
and by promising this man, and buying off that
one with an office, and setting their papers to telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
all sorts of lies, they get the country so confounded at
last that it doesn't know whether it is on its head or its
heels. But the worst of it is, these very Federals&mdash;some
of them real old Blue Lights&mdash;go about preaching
about rich and poor, and sowing enmity between them;
and they work so diligent upon this heat, that many a
simple man at last believes them. It's all a trick&mdash;a
mean, sneaking deceit, which I am ashamed to think
any honest poor man in this happy country of ours
could be taken in by for one minute. But we never
had this talk until we got Federal measures and Federal
men at the head of the Government. Who are the
rich that they talk about? Why, it is every man who
has sense enough to know that they are imposing on
him, whether he be worth a million or worth only five
hundred dollars&mdash;unless indeed it be one of their own
rich men, and then they can't praise him too much. Is
industry a sin in this land, that when it has earned a
little something for a wet day, the man who has thriven
by it must be held up as an enemy to his country?
Does it hurt a man's patriotism, when he sends his
children to school, and works until he can buy a tract
of land to start them well in life&mdash;or when he rents a
pew in church, and carries his family there to teach
them to fear God and keep his commandments? Is
it to be told <i>against</i> a man, that his neighbors count
him to be frugal and thrifty, and that he is considered
respectable in the world? Yet that is your new fashioned
Democracy, which wants to put every one in the
dust who doesn't idle away his time and squander his
substance, and let his family go to rack, whilst he
strolls about the country bawling Democracy. Thank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
God! the Democracy I've larnt in my time has taught
me to do to others as I would have others do to me;
and which has imbibed into my mind the principle that
I am a freeman, and have a right to think for myself,
to speak for myself, and to act for myself, without
having a string put through my nose to lead me
wherever it suits a set of scheming, lying, cunning
politicians to have me for their benefit. Democracy's
not what it used to be, or you would never find the
people putting up with this eternal dictation from the
President and his friends to Congress and to the
nation, what he will have, and what he won't have:&mdash;that's
what I call rank monarchy, and I will fight against
it to my latest breath.</p>

<p>"You will have a chance to judge for yourselves
whether the President dictates to the people or not, in
this very matter of the Sub-Treasury:&mdash;wait till the
next session of Congress:&mdash;the bill has just been
rejected a second time. You will see that Martin isn't
a going to give it up, but will bring it forward again
and again&mdash;until at last, I make no doubt, he will get
a Congress shabby enough to do his bidding, and pass
it;&mdash;and many of the very men who are against it to-day,
will abandon their own opinions and go for it, for
no other reason in the world but that they will be afraid
of their nose-leaders, who will tell them they are no
Democrats unless they support the President. It is
nothing more nor less than <i>enlisting</i> men in the
service, and marching and countermarching them
whichever way the <i>officers</i> choose; besides bringing
every man to a drum-head who dares to disobey
orders."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's Tom Benton's notion?" inquired Neal
Hopper.</p>

<p>"He goes for the Sub-Treasury out and out," said
Pivot.</p>

<p>"In course, he does, all hollow," interrupted Tom
Crop, with rather a fierce frown and an angry tone,
designed to express his indignant feeling at the sentiments
uttered by Abel Brawn, and which sternness of
countenance had been gradually gathering during the
whole time occupied by the Blacksmith's discourse.
"There's none of this slang in him. He's agin all
Monypolies, and for the rale Constitutional Currency&mdash;and
them's the genuine Dimmicratic principles:&mdash;leastways,
they've come about so now, whatever
they might 'a been in times past. Old Tom's the
first man what ever found out what the Constitutional
Currency raly was, and sot the Dimmicrats a goin' on
the Hard-Money track! And, besides, don't I know
these banks?&mdash;they're nuisances in grain, and naturally
as good as strikes a poor man in his vitals. I've seed
it myself. Here was Joe Plumb, the cider-press maker,
got a note from Jerry Lantern down here at the crossroads,
for settin' up his cider-press, and he heaved it in
the bank for them to collect it&mdash;and what does the
bank do, but go and <i>purtest</i> it! That's the way they
treat a poor man like Joe Plumb, what's obliged to
work for his livin':&mdash;would they 'a sarved a Big Bug
so? No&mdash;don't tell me about the banks! I'm sick a
hearin' on 'em."</p>

<p>This discussion was now interrupted by the approach
of Theodore Fog, Flan Sucker, and Sim Travers. By
this addition to the company, the New Lights gained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
an overwhelming preponderance of numbers over their
adversaries. Indeed, Abel Brawn, and Davy Post, the
wheelwright, were the only Whigs in the assemblage;
and the consequence was that Abel, who fought them
all pretty manfully at first, was obliged to give in so
far as to remain silent&mdash;with the exception of a random
shot, which now and then he let off by way of repartee&mdash;Abel
not being bad at that. Davy Post was naturally
a silent man, and, therefore, did not pretend to be a
speaker on this occasion.</p>

<p>As soon as Theodore Fog was informed what was the
topic in debate, and especially of the doubts which
seemed to be prevalent regarding the Sub-Treasury,
he took a station against the door-post, where the
whole company gathered around him; and, being now
in an oratorical mood, he began to address the auditory
in something like a speech:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said he, at the same time drawing,
with a jerk, his neckcloth away and flaunting it in his
hand, "in a free government we have no secrets.
Freedom of Opinion and its twin-sister Freedom of
Discussion are chartered libertines that float upon the
ambient air consecrated to the Genius of Universal
Emancipation&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hurra for old The!" shouted Sim Travers.</p>

<p>"Ya&mdash;hoop&mdash;halloo&mdash;go it!" yelled Flan Sucker,
with a wild and deafening scream, which sufficiently
manifested the fact that he was most noisily drunk.</p>

<p>Several of the company interfered by remonstrating
with Flan against this unnecessary demonstration
of fervor, which Flan, on the other hand, insisted
upon as his right.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whenever old The. Fog comes out high flown,"
said he, "I yells as a matter of principle. It's
encouragin' to youth. Nebuchadnezzar, the King of
the Jews, couldn't beat him at a speech: he's the butt
cut of Democracy."</p>

<p>"Flan, hold your tongue," said Theodore. "Gentlemen,
we have no secrets. Abel Brawn and Davy
Post are welcome to hear all I have to impart. I
know&mdash;everybody knows&mdash;that we have been in a state
of suspense on the great question of the Sub-Treasury.
The <span class="smcap lowercase">Independent</span> Treasury, as we are going to call it
since Congress rejected it&mdash;we'll try what a new name
will do. I say we have been in suspense. Like honest
New Lights we have waited to see how the cat would
jump. Some men imagined that Martin would bow to
the judgment of the people and give it up. They did
not know the stern, uncompromising, footstep-following
principles that dwell at the bottom of his heart. He
will <i>never</i> give it up&mdash;the people <i>must</i> take it: he has
got nothing else for them. Hasn't he tried everything
else? And isn't this the <i>last</i> thing he could think of?
Why, then, of course, the people <i>must</i> gulp it down, or
the party is broke. Where is the slave that would
desert his party? Who's here so base would be a turncoat?
The Whigs call the President the <i>servant</i> of the
people&mdash;we call him the Ruler, the Great Chieftain,&mdash;and
when a man deserts him he is a <span class="smcap lowercase">TURNCOAT</span>&mdash;that is
sound New-Light doctrine.</p>

<p>"Sirs, it has been developed in the recent demonstrations
of contemporary history&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yip!"</p>

<p>"Silence, Flan Sucker, and don't make a fool of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
yourself. It has been discovered that bank influence
has defeated the Sub-Treasury bill. Every member
who voted against it has received a large bribe from
the banks. The Globe man has lately discovered this
astounding corruption: the President is aware of it;
and for this reason, in addition to that which I have
already mentioned, he is determined to run it as the
<span class="smcap">Independent</span> Treasury again. Every New Light is
expected to toe the mark."</p>

<p>"Three cheers for that!" cried Pivot.</p>

<p>"We have heretofore <i>partially</i> denounced the
banks," continued Fog; "we are now to open upon
them like hounds&mdash;worry them like rats. From this
day forth, the Quods will take a new turn;&mdash;they will
dismiss all pity from their bosoms, and cry aloud for
strangling the banks&mdash;not even excepting our own.
Patriotism demands the sacrifice. Down with paper
money! will be the word. Turn the tables on the
Whigs, and call the whole bank system the spawn of
aristocracy&mdash;remember that. At the same time, gentlemen,
be not afraid. No harm will be done to any bank
you have a liking for&mdash;the essence of the thing is in
the noise. We shall have perhaps to kill the banks in
the District of Columbia&mdash;but that's nothing;&mdash;it will
be an offering to consistency. All experiments require
an exhausted receiver&mdash;and the District is ours;&mdash;a
snug little piece of machinery to play upon. So keep
it in mind&mdash;Treasury Notes and no Paper Money!&mdash;down
with Credit, and up with the Independent
Treasury!"</p>

<p>"Ain't that first-rate?" said Sim Travers. "The.,
who sot that agoin'?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who?" replied Fog. "Why, some of the highest
men in this nation&mdash;the Lights of the age. Middleton
Flam has just received letters from Washington, laying
open the whole plan of operations. He has accordingly
determined to put himself in position for
ultimate action, by resigning the presidency of the
bank. Middleton Flam, gentlemen, I am free to say
it, although we have differed on some questions, is a
great man and an honor to the New Lights. He has
already sent his resignation to Nicodemus Handy.
The Board meet to-morrow to act upon it. You may
imagine, gentlemen, who is looked to as his successor.
But I here announce to <i>you</i>, the conglomerate essence
of my constituency at large, that on no consideration
can I be persuaded to accept the vacant place. No,
gentlemen, the whole tenor of my life renders that impossible.
I have defined my position years ago; and
every man must see, that president of that, or any
other bank, I can never be. Simon Snuffers is the
man. If he can make it agreeable to the Democratic
principle upon which he holds the Hay Scales&mdash;and
that it is for you to say&mdash;I have no doubt he will accept.
Simon has no ulterior objects;&mdash;and men without
ulterior objects may do as they please. But I
trust that this responsible post will never be pressed
upon me. Upon that point I cannot indulge the
wishes of my friends."</p>

<p>The importance of this speech was duly appreciated
by those to whom it was addressed; and as every man
was anxious to know what everybody else thought
about these matters, there was an immediate adjournment
to the Borough. The consequence was, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Abel Brawn's shop was left in a few moments without
a customer; and in the course of the next half hour
the news communicated by Theodore Fog was in every
man's mouth. The movement at Washington was held
to be decisive. The Independent Treasury, from that
moment, became a leading test of the allegiance of the
Democrats of Quodlibet.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

PRINCIPLE&mdash;HARDBOTTLE UNPOPULAR.</p>

<p class="p2">The fact was as Theodore Fog had stated it. Mr.
Flam had received a letter from a member of the
Cabinet, apprising him that it was deemed absolutely
necessary to the preservation of the New-Light Democratic
Party to become extremely pointed in their
assault against the State Banks, and that the misdeeds
of those institutions should be exaggerated as much as
possible, and then charged upon the Whigs.</p>

<p>"This attack," said the letter, "must be made with
more than usual clamor, and followed up with unremitting
industry, that, by force of the first word and incessant
repetition, we may get the people to believe
that we have had nothing to do with the creation of
these corporations; but have, in fact, been inveterately
hostile to them from the first, and that our opponents
have been their sole patrons and friends. Our recent
outcry on this subject has succeeded so well with the
people, that we are determined now to make the denunciation
of the banks our chief topic, by way of pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>paration
for the Independent Treasury which we are
resolved the people shall swallow. We cannot too
strongly impress upon our friends the propriety of
charging upon the Whigs that we have repeatedly
warned them against increasing the number of banks
in the States. By this device we shall put upon their
shoulders all those mischiefs of <i>over-banking</i> and <i>over-trading</i>,
which <i>they</i> used to talk about. We must impute
to them all the evils of the paper system&mdash;except
the Treasury notes, which it would be well for us to
praise, as an admirable Democratic scheme to give the
country a <span class="smcap lowercase">METALLIC</span> currency. It has also been deemed
important," continued the writer, "that we should prove
that the government has lost more money by the State
banks than by any other agents it has ever employed.
This idea was hinted to the Secretary of the Treasury,
who has, in consequence, very recently been at work
upon the subject, and has produced a report altogether
conclusive against the banks. He will continue these
labors with a view to the instruction of Congress and
all our other inquiring friends; being, in no respect,
daunted by that unlucky report made by him in 1834,
which, singularly enough, proves the opposite side of
the case; for, as he remarks, the specific gravity of his
State papers is so great as to sink them too deep for
the perception of the present generation,&mdash;and that
consequently his report of 1834 must be pretty well
forgotten by this time, which, indeed, I think quite
likely;&mdash;it was so long-winded, dozy, and prosy, (a
note in the margin marked this as 'confidential,') that
I should not wonder if more than ten men in Congress
ever read it, and of those, perhaps not a single one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
retains any distinct impression of its meaning." The
letter exhorted Mr. Flam to make these views known
to the drill sergeants and corporals of the party in
Quodlibet, and to stimulate them to active exertions in
the part assigned to them. "Pound it into public
mind," said the writer, "that the Whigs are the
authors of the present evils; continual pounding will
inevitably, at last, do the business. Many a time have
I riveted, by diligent hammering, a politic and necessary
fabrication upon the credulity of the people&mdash;so
fast that no art of my adversary could tear it away to
make room for the truth: therefore, I say to you and
our Democratic friends&mdash;hammer without ceasing."</p>

<p>A letter also from the Secretary, at the same time,
informed Mr. Flam, that as the people had so contumaciously
rejected the Independent Treasury bill, by
their representatives in Congress, the President was
now determined to carry it at all hazards; and consequently
it was expected that no New-Light Democrat
would be so false to the glorious principles of the
Quodlibetarian theory as to interpose any opinion of
his own between the will of the President and the appropriate
duty of the people. "If such should be the
case," said the Secretary, "Mr. Van Buren can have
no alternative&mdash;the individual so recreant to the eternal
principles of the New-Light Democracy must be denounced
by the Globe as an enemy to freedom, and,
what is worse, a traitor to his party."</p>

<p>Mr. Flam reflected upon these communications with
grave attention; and having shown them to some of his
intimate friends, among whom I count it my highest
honor to be ranked, he announced his purpose to re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>sign
his post in the bank. For this step he had two
good reasons: the first was the necessity of disencumbering
himself of a connection which might have impeded
his usefulness&mdash;to use his own words&mdash;in his
public relations; the second reason was, that he had
borrowed so large an amount from the bank, as to circumscribe
its bounty greatly to the prejudice of sundry
of the directors who were, in consequence, beginning
to complain of his management of the institution, and
were even threatening to run an opposition against him
in the election which was but a few months off. It was
whispered also that Nicodemus Handy had given him a
mysterious but friendly hint to resign, without explaining
his reasons. Upon these considerations his mind
was made up; and accordingly the resignation was
laid before the Board at the time indicated by Theodore
Fog.</p>

<p>This event produced great sensation in Quodlibet;
not less from the curiosity to know why our distinguished
representative should relinquish so lucrative a
post, than from the interest felt in the measure of
selecting his successor. Fifteen of our most strenuous
New-Light Democrats were candidates; and notwithstanding
the speech made at the blacksmith's shop,
Theodore Fog was the first who wrote a letter to the
Board to apprise them that, in consequence of the eager
importunity of his Democratic friends to confide the
bank to his management, he found himself compelled
to forego his objections to having any concern with the
banking system, and therefore would not feel himself
at liberty to decline the Presidency in case it should
be offered to him. He said he wished it to be distinctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
understood, that emolument was not his object: but
that he was actuated solely by his attachment to that
New-Light Democratic principle which taught him on
all occasions to seek preferment, as the means of
widening the sphere of his usefulness, and to increase
his worldly fortune only for the sake of the good it
enabled him to dispense to the people. On no other
terms was he willing to accept the government of the
bank.</p>

<p>Some two or three days were spent in canvassing
this matter; when the choice ultimately, upon the
twenty-fifth balloting, fell upon Anthony Hardbottle,
who had not been previously thought of for the place,
and was only brought forward when all attempts to
elect others had failed. The fifteen original candidates
became greatly incensed at this choice. Theodore Fog
was furious: he said Hardbottle could scarcely be
called a Democrat:&mdash;if anything, he was half Whig&mdash;nay,
he believed, whole Whig:&mdash;and to elect a Whig
to a great responsible post like that&mdash;a post connected
with the national fisc, allied to the money power, so
intimately related to the important concerns of the
currency!&mdash;it was not to be tolerated. The Genius of
New-Light Democracy should array herself in steel,
indue herself in panoply, buckle on her armor, shake
her lance against it, or, in other words, he deemed it
incompatible with free institutions to allow a Whig, or,
at least, a man who never attended political meetings,
and who held the Whigs in respect&mdash;to preside over
such a Democratic institution as the Copperplate Bank
of Quodlibet. Theodore continued raving in this strain
until he drank nine juleps, interspersed with numberless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
other potations, and became so incapable of motion as
to render it necessary for Mrs. Ferret to have him
carried to bed. As he cooled, so cooled his competitors.
Indeed, in the course of a few days, Theodore
Fog, in commenting upon the pretensions of the several
defeated candidates, found so many objections to them
individually and collectively, as to bring himself into
an excellent temper upon the subject, whereby he was
able to make merry with the whole election; and thus,
by degrees, he fell back into the state of mind which
he had manifested at the smith's shop, and declared
that no consideration could possibly induce him, professing
the principles he did, to accept any post connected
with a bank. He expressed himself in sharp
and censorious terms against what, he said, he had
constantly observed: namely, that he never knew a
post in a bank to be vacant, from the President down
to the porter, including Directors and all, in regard to
which he didn't find half a dozen Loco Focos, to say
nothing of New-Light Democrats, applicants to fill the
vacancy: he thought it inconsistent with principle, now
that orders had come for the Democracy to abuse the
banks, to seek or accept such places; and he did not
care who knew his sentiments upon the subject.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardbottle was a strict man of business, and did
not, it is true, greatly interest himself in politics. Yet,
nevertheless, he was a decided supporter of the New-Light
cause, and was always esteemed a useful member
of the Borough. One thing that made against him in
the Board was, that he had never been a very active
customer to the bank, except so far only as keeping
his commercial account there. He was often urged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
accept accommodations with a view to the improvement
of the Borough, but almost invariably refused, from an
aversion to indulging in these useful speculations. His
brother Directors, in consequence, rather regarded him
as a man who was deficient in public spirit; and they
imagined that he might be inclined to depreciate the
value of the services they had rendered the bank by
the liberal employment they had given to its funds.
Mr. Hardbottle, therefore, might be said to have
entered into the government of the bank under inauspicious
circumstances, and was likely not to be a very
popular President. He was, however, determined upon
one thing, and that was to make a thorough examination
of the bank for the purpose of bringing about a
resumption of specie payments at the earliest possible
moment; for some complaints had gone abroad against
the Bank of Quodlibet for not resuming when the other
banks of the country affected to be anxious for that
measure.</p>

<p>In consequence of this determination of the new
President, the bank was kept in perpetual bustle for
the whole fortnight succeeding the election. What
then occurred will be told in the next chapter.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

incident in the Borough which overmasters all these
emotions by the height and the depth, the length and
the breadth, the stupendous magnitude of the amazement
which it has spread through all minds.</p>

<p>The investigation of the affairs of the bank, under
the direction of Mr. Hardbottle, lasted more than a
fortnight. They were not yet brought to a close, when&mdash;&mdash; Let
the following paragraph from an extra
Whole Hog, issued on the spur of the moment, tell the
rest. I have no nerve for such a disclosure.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><h3>"ASTOUNDING WHIG DEFALCATION.</h3>

<p>"Our Borough has just been thrown into a state of
stupefaction by an event which completely eclipses
every other act of crime and villainy with which the
annals of Whiggery abound. Nicodemus Handy, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
Whig Cashier of that extortionate, swindling Whig
rag-factory, the Patriotic Copperplate Bank of Quodlibet,
left this Borough yesterday morning in the
People's Line, which runs through Thorough Blue. As
this journey was undertaken with the pretense of
business, it attracted no attention until this morning,
when the indefatigable Democratic President of that
institution, Mr. Anthony Hardbottle, who was recently
elected for the purpose of a thorough investigation
into its concerns, (suspicions having been long indulged
of its rottenness; and, in fact, our worthy representative,
the Hon. Middleton Flam, an unterrified and
incorruptible New Light, having retired from the head
of the institution on account of the disgusting irregularities
which fell within his view,) laid a statement
before the Board which showed that the Cashier had
secreted upwards of $160,000, the greater part of
which funds there is reason to believe he has made
away with in the course of the last three months.
Measures were taken to pursue the offender, and as far
as possible to secure the bank by attachments upon
his property, which is supposed to be considerable.
For the present, we forbear all comment, except so far
as to remark, that we look upon this atrocious fraud
but as the natural fruit of that system of Whig measures
which has cumbered the land with mushroom
banks, filthy rags, and swarms of scrub aristocrats in
the shape of presidents, cashiers, directors, and clerks.
We may speedily expect to hear of many more Whigs
following the example of our absquatulating Cashier."</p></div>

<p>The sensation produced in the Borough by this intelligence
is not to be described. The flight of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
Handy was the only topic of conversation for a week.
An officer followed him to Thorough Blue, whence, it
was rumored, the fugitive had shaped his course for
Texas: other reports assigned Canada as his place of
refuge&mdash;all was uncertainty. Legal measures were
taken to secure his property. This consisted of his elegant
mansion on Copperplate Ridge, sundry rows of
warehouses, and other buildings in Quodlibet, a large
number of which had been left for two years past in an
unfinished state. Upon investigation it was ascertained
that the whole of this estate had been converted into
money; our worthy representative, the Hon. Middleton
Flam, having an absolute conveyance for Handy
House, its furniture, and appurtenances, and certain
political friends, connected with the custom-house in
New York, rank Whigs, having mortgages on all the
rest of the property. The consequence was, the bank
was able to secure nothing.</p>

<p>One of our first proceedings, after the flight of the
Cashier, was to call together the New-Light Club, where
resolutions were passed denouncing his fraud as the necessary
consequence of his Whig principles, censuring
the bank, in the strongest terms, as a swindling Whig
concern, and avowing an unalterable devotion to the Independent
Treasury, as the only sound, genuine, New-Light
Democratic experiment which it was proper for
the government to make, in the present condition
of affairs&mdash;unless the President should change his mind
and find out something still more Democratic; in which
event the New-Light Club pledged itself to give that
other measure their cordial and patriotic support.</p>

<p>In the course of a fortnight, the inhabitants of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Borough were surprised to read from a New York
paper, in the list of passengers who sailed for Liverpool
by the packet of the first of October, among the
names of sundry fashionables, those also of Mrs. and
Miss Handy; and we were, not long afterward, relieved
from all doubt as to the Cashier's destination, by seeing
it publicly announced that he had gone to Havre, from
which point, as soon as he could be joined by his interesting
and distressed family, he designed making
the tour of Europe.</p>

<p>From the period of the elopement of Mr. Handy, we
had a series of convulsions. The first incident of importance
that followed it, was the failure of the whole
Board of Directors; each of whom, according to his
own showing, had lost so much money by the absconding
Cashier as to be totally unable to pay up his liabilities
to the bank. The next disaster was the explosion
of the bank itself. The abduction of so large an amount
of its funds, as well as its unfortunate list of bad debts
from the Directors, rendered this inevitable. Then came
riots among the holders of its paper, who besieged the
door for several days, and even threatened to pull down
the building. Never was a community in a more unhappy
commotion than ours at this eventful epoch.</p>

<p>Mr. Grant visited the Borough frequently during the
prevalence of these disorders. One day he met Theodore
Fog, who seemed to be rather pleasurably excited
by the events which occupied and engrossed the public
attention&mdash;for Theodore, as he was in the habit of remarking,
had nothing to lose by these domestic convulsions,
and everything to gain. The election was at
hand, and he was again the True-Grit candidate; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
on this occasion there was no opposition from his own
party, and the chance of electing a Whig was deemed
hopeless. That side made no nomination; and Fog,
therefore, with his two colleagues of the last year, was
in a fair way to walk over the course without a contest.
The interests of the election, consequently, were altogether
absorbed in the other incidents of the day.
Still, Theodore was not inattentive to the voters, and
was, as usual, loquacious and voluble.</p>

<p>"A pretty considerable upheaving of the elements
of social life, Mr. Grant," said he, upon encountering
the old gentleman on Ferret's steps at the front
door of The Hero.</p>

<p>"I think so," replied Mr. Grant; "you have brought
your pigs at last to a fine market."</p>

<p>"<i>Our</i> pigs!" exclaimed Fog, with an excellent representation
of surprise:&mdash;"well, that beats M'Gonegal,
and he beat the devil. The whole litter comes
from a Whig mother: it is the spawn of that aristocracy,
against which the intelligence, the honor, and
the virtue of the nation have been waging war ever
since the Reign of Terror;&mdash;but, sir, it is down; the
intelligence and firmness of the people have triumphed
at last."</p>

<p>"You allude, I suppose, to your Democratic bank
here," said Mr. Grant.</p>

<p>"No doubt," replied Fog, "the Whigs will attempt
to shuffle the bank off <i>their</i> shoulders and buckle it on
the Democrats. But that won't do, sir; that's too
stale a trick to deceive the people. The Whigs, sir,
are men of property; the Democrats are poor, sir.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
Banks are not made by poor men, Mr. Grant; there's
the logic of the case."</p>

<p>"And this Patriotic Copperplate Bank of Quodlibet
was not set on foot by Nicodemus Handy and Theodore
Fog?" returned Mr. Grant.</p>

<p>"By Nicodemus Handy," replied Fog, "not by me.
Sir, Nicodemus was always a Whig; and, what's more,
attempted to beguile me into his scheme. He took
advantage of my unsuspecting temper&mdash;endeavored to
lull into security my artless, confiding nature; essayed,
sir, but in vain, to seduce me from my allegiance to the
Democratic faith, by tempting offers of the presidency
of the bank&mdash;but, sir, my virtue was too stern for his
treacherous arts. I saw the gilded bait and spurned it.
It was&mdash;I say it myself&mdash;a rare example of successful
resistance to the fascinations of the tempter. Many a
Democrat has fallen into the snare of the Whigs under
less allurement. I pride myself on this evidence of
self-command. I have reason to be proud of it."</p>

<p>"You have a short memory," said Mr. Grant.</p>

<p>"Why as to that, old friend," replied Fog with a
good-natured laugh, at the same time laying his hand
on Mr. Grant's shoulder, "you can't call <i>that</i> a fault.
Every politician has a short memory&mdash;he'd be no politician
without it. Mine's no shorter than the rest.
Sir, let me tell you, the great secret of the success of
the immutable, New-Light, Quodlibetarian Democracy,
is in the shortness of the memory. Still, I would like
to know what you mean by the remark."</p>

<p>"I mean to say," replied Mr. Grant, "that when
you and Nicodemus Handy were endeavoring to per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>suade
me to take an interest in your bank, you didn't
think it so undemocratic as you seem to do to-day."</p>

<p>"It is impossible for me to remember what I said on
the occasion to which you allude, sir," returned Fog;
"but my principles have always been the same. I
could not have gone against them, sir; morally impossible."</p>

<p>"And I told you that your bank was a humbug,"
continued Mr. Grant.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," rejoined Fog; "that's the old song.
You Whigs are monstrous good at prophesying after
the result is known."</p>

<p>"You admit, I suppose," said Mr. Grant, "that this
Bank of Quodlibet has exploded?"</p>

<p>"Burst, sir, into a thousand tatters," replied Fog.</p>

<p>"You admit that there is a large amount of paper
money afloat?"</p>

<p>"A genuine Whig crop," answered Fog: "enough
to make a stack as large as the largest in your barnyard."</p>

<p>"You admit the derangement of values all over the
country?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and of the people too, if you make it a
point."</p>

<p>"The failures of traders and of banks?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"This is reasonable, Mr. Fog. Now, you shall judge
whether the Whigs prophesy <i>before</i> or <i>after</i> the result,"
said Mr. Grant, as he thrust his hand into his skirt
pocket and drew forth a pamphlet. "I expected to
meet you to-day, and I have brought you a document<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
for your especial perusal. It is the speech of a Whig
member of Congress, made in 1834, upon the Removal
of the Deposits;&mdash;you will find the leaf turned down
at page 32; and, as you are a good reader, I wish you
would favor this company by reading it aloud, where
you see it scored in the margin."</p>

<p>"Not I," replied Theodore; "that's four years ago.
The statute of limitation bars that."</p>

<p>"He's afeard to read it," said Abel Brawn to some
five or six persons, who had collected around the steps
during this conversation. "Mr. Grant's mighty particular
with his documents, and ain't to be shook off in
an argument."</p>

<p>"The., you ain't afeard, old fellow?" said Flan
Sucker. "Walk into him, The. Read it."</p>

<p>"Give me the book," said Fog, "and let's see what
it is. Speech by Horace Binney&mdash;eh? Who's he? I
think I have heard the name. Well, for the sake
of obliging a friend, I'll read.&mdash;<i>Conticuere omnes</i>&mdash;which
means listen." Fog then read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is here that we find a pregnant source of the
present agony&mdash;it is in the clearly avowed design to
bring a second time upon this land the curse of an unregulated,
uncontrolled State-Bank paper currency.
We are again to see the drama which already, in the
course of the present century, has passed before us,
and closed in ruin. If the project shall be successful&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What project?" inquired Fog.</p>

<p>"The destruction of the Bank of the United States,
and the refusal to create another in its place," answered
Mr. Grant.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>Theodore read on&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If the project shall be successful, we are again to
see these paper missiles shooting in every direction
through the country&mdash;a derangement of all values,&mdash;a
depreciated circulation&mdash;a suspension of specie payments;&mdash;then
a further extension of the same detestable
paper&mdash;a still greater depreciation&mdash;with failures
of traders and failures of banks in its train&mdash;to arrive
at last at the same point from which we departed
in 1817."</p></div>

<p>"A rank forgery," said Theodore Fog, "printed for
the occasion."</p>

<p>"That won't do," replied Mr. Grant; "I have been
the owner of this pamphlet ever since 1834 myself."</p>

<p>"Then Binney is a Dimmycrat," said Sim Travers,
"and you are trying to pass him off on us for a Whig.
Sound Dimmycratic doctrine and true prophecy."</p>

<p>"Huzza for Binney!" shouted Flan Sucker, "a tip-top
Dimmycrat, whoever he is!&mdash;I never heard of him
before."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Grant, "one ounce of his Democracy
is worth a ton weight of the best you will find in
the Globe. But read on, a little further below, where
you see it scored."</p>

<p>"I have an innate and mortal aversion to reading,"
returned Fog.</p>

<p>"It must be gone through," said Flan Sucker,&mdash;"because
them sentiments is the rale Dimmocracy, and
we want to hear them. So, go it, The!&mdash;Yip&mdash;listen
boys, to the doctrine."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said Fog, "if you will have it&mdash;as the pillory
said to the thief, 'lend me your ears.'"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I thank the Secretary," he began with a discreet
voice, reading where Mr. Grant appointed for him,
"for the disclosure of this plan. I trust in God it will
be defeated: that the Bank of the United States, while
it is in existence, may be sustained and strengthened
by the public opinion, and interests of the people, to
defeat it: that the sound and sober State banks of the
Union may resist it&mdash;for it is their cause: that the
poor men and laborers in the land may resist it&mdash;for it
is a scheme to get from every one of them a dollar's
worth of labor for fifty cents, and to make fraud the currency
of the country as much as paper. Sir, the Bank
of the United States, in any other relation than to the
currency and property of the country, is as little to
me as to any man under heaven; but after the prime
and vigor of life are passed, and the power of accumulation
is gone, to see the children stripped, by the monstrous
imposture of a paper currency, of all that the
father's industry had provided for them&mdash;this, sir, may
well excuse the warmth that denounces this plan, as
the precursor of universal dismay and ruin."</p></div>

<p>"I'll read no more," said Fog, giving back the
book, with a theatrical flourish of his arm, to Mr.
Grant; "it is nothing more than stealing our principles
from us, and then bringing them up to break our
heads."</p>

<p>"It is good Whig prophecy, four years before its
fulfillment," said Mr. Grant, "and which has come true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
to the letter. It shows you that we set our faces
against your increase of banks in the very beginning;
gave you warning of what was to come; painted the
very evils of this day so plainly before your eyes that
nothing but willful blindness prevented you from seeing
them; and now, when it has all fallen out as it was
foretold, you attempt to make us responsible to the
people for your measures."</p>

<p>"Sir," said Fog, rather evading the argument, as it
is an admirable part of the New-Light system to do
when it pinches, "the New-Light Democracy changes
its measures, but never its principles. We go, sir, for
the will of the people&mdash;that's the principle which lies
at the bottom of all our actions. If the people are for
new measures, we frankly come out with them. Now,
sir, the people are <i>against</i> the banks&mdash;they are <i>for</i> the
Independent Treasury: of course, then, you know
where to find <i>us</i>. You can't get round us&mdash;there we
are."</p>

<p>"I'll not dispute that point with you," replied Mr.
Grant; "you have been changing from bad to worse
ever since you have had the control of affairs. I only
wanted to remind you that the present distress of the
country is the work of your own hands, and that you
have brought it about with your eyes open."</p>

<p>Saying these words Mr. Grant walked off toward the
stable, where he mounted his horse and rode out of the
Borough.</p>

<p>As soon as the old gentleman was gone, Theodore
Fog remarked that he had not had as dry a talk for
some years, and proposed to the company a general
visit to the bar.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>"They talk of <i>distress</i>," said he. "Mr. Grant has
gone off with his head full of that notion of distress;
it's a famous Whig argument, that. But what distress
is there? Drinking's as cheap; eating's as cheap as
ever; so is lying. Eating, drinking, and lying, are the
three principal occupations of man. Lying <i>down</i>, I
mean, metaphorically for sleeping. Where's the distress,
then? Mere panic&mdash;false alarm&mdash;a Whig invention!
The country is better off than it ever was
before. Not for men who trade upon credit, I allow&mdash;not
for merchants and shippers in general&mdash;not for
your fellows that go about for jobs&mdash;not for farmers&mdash;not
for regular laborers&mdash;not for mechanics, with
families on their hands, and perhaps not for single ones
neither;&mdash;but first-rate for lawyers, bar-keepers, and
brokers, for marshals and sheriffs&mdash;capital for constables&mdash;nonpareil
for postmasters, contractors, express-riders,
and office-holders; and glorious for fellows that
are fond of talking and have nothing to do:&mdash;these are

<p>"Mr. Fog," said Jesse Ferret, "I am so well pleased
at your reading for Mr. Grant this morning, that I'm
determined to give you a treat;&mdash;help yourself and
your friends. Gentlemen, walk up."</p>

<p>"Glad you liked it, old buck," replied Fog. "Bless
your heart, I'm used to such things. A political man
must always be ready for rubbers; never would get a
gloss if it wasn't for brushing. That Binney's a smart
fellow; but every word of that speech was whispered
into his ear by Benton; I know the fact personally.
He and Benton sit up every night of their lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>

<p class="chapt-summary smaller">A RAPID REVIEW OF ONE YEAR&mdash;WHAT THE AUTHOR IS COMPELLED
TO PRETERMIT&mdash;THE PRESIDENT'S "SOBER SECONDTHOUGHT" MESSAGE
RECEIVED AT QUODLIBET WITH GREAT REJOICING&mdash;THE
AUTHOR COMMUNES WITH HIS READER TOUCHING NEW-LIGHT PRINCIPLES&mdash;ILLUSTRATIONS
OF THEM&mdash;REMARKABLE DEXTERITY OF
THE SECRETARY&mdash;INTERESTING LETTER FROM THE HON. MIDDLETON
FLAM&mdash;DAWNING OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CANVASS&mdash;THE NORTHERN
MAN WITH SOUTHERN PRINCIPLES AND HIS MANNIKIN.</p>

<p class="p2">Time held his course. Another year went by, and
brought us to the sixth since the Removal. The year
which I pass over was marked by many public and
domestic incidents worthy of note in the history of
Quodlibet. Gladly would I have tarried to entertain
my reader with some of these; but I am admonished
of the necessity of bringing these desultory annals to
a close. Especially might I find much to interest many
of those who will peruse these pages, in the private and
personal affairs of the Borough; some of the events
of the bygone year being of a nature to kindle up
pathetic emotions in their bosoms. The blank despair
of Agamemnon Flag when he first heard of the flight
of Nicodemus Handy; his melancholy visits of consolation
to the bereaved family; the disinterested
avowal of his long-smothered and smouldering love to
the heiress apparent; and his offer of his hand and
fortune&mdash;consisting of a new suit of clothes, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
horse and gig, purchased on credit&mdash;to this dejected
lady; his still blanker despair, his disappointment and
vows of revenge when, after listening to his suit, he
found it announced that she had sailed without him, to
make the grand tour of Europe; and finally, the stoical
philosophy with which he renounced all claim to the
reversionary interest in the one hundred and sixty
thousand dollars taken from the bank, as well as the
net proceeds of Handy Place, and the rows of buildings,
finished and unfinished, in Quodlibet&mdash;these incidents
would furnish an episode of tenderness and
passion without a parallel since the Medea of Euripides.</p>

<p>But these excursions are foreign from the purpose
of this book, and I am sure would be disallowed by the
respectable committee at whose instance I have entered
upon this task. Indeed, they have explicitly enjoined
that I divulge nothing under their sanction, touching the
concerns of Quodlibet which in any manner borders upon
the romantic. Upon these subjects their caution is,
Nulli tacuisse nocet, tutum silentii prmium. I must,
therefore, reluctantly pretermit all such matter&mdash;reserving
for some other occasion the gratification of the
public curiosity therein.</p>

<p>In looking back upon the public events of this interval,
I deem it necessary, in passing, merely to notice
the fact that the New Lights were greatly rejoiced to
find in Mr. Van Buren's message to Congress a complete
justification of the Secretary's promise to Mr.
Flam, the import of which was to assure our representative
that the President had made up his mind, after
the rejection of that measure, to carry the Independent
Treasury in spite of the people. Our uncompromising,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
fearless, and <i>unshakable</i> Quods, true to the dictates
of their creed, were, I repeat, greatly rejoiced at the
manly perseverance and unquenchable self-will with
which the President delivered over that question to the
"Sober Secondthoughts" (a pest upon the unlucky
coincidence of that phrase with my patronymic!&mdash;it
hath given license to the tongues of the wags, to my
annoyance) of the people. Every good New-Light
Democrat in the land understood the hint&mdash;and a
presidential hint is no small matter to a Democrat
now-a-days. Truly delightful was it to see how it
acted upon the New Lights. Not a man among them
who had hitherto halted on a scruple of conscience, but
became thereupon, in the twinkling of an eye, a devoted
champion of the Independent Treasury; and
that, too, without knowing, or caring to know, what it
was. It was hoisted in capitals, at the head of
Eliphalet Fox's Weekly, and became forthwith, as it
were, a word written on our banner. We were, one
and all, converted into milites subsignani, and became
the Maccabees of this new kind of Independent
Treasury.</p>

<p>It has doubtless often occurred to the reader of this
irregular history to inquire how it comes to pass that
the historian has ventured to relate with such composure,
nay, with such complacency, what superficial
thinkers, at least, might deem to be the <i>changes</i> in the
political principles of the New Lights. Superficial is
a good word, and truly explains the case. Our
<i>principles</i>, as every one who is gifted with sufficient
astuteness could not fail to have observed throughout
this narrative&mdash;and as, in fact, we have more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
once insinuated&mdash;are much deeper than the <i>measures</i>
we, from time to time, find it convenient to adopt. We
hold a change of measures, a change of opinions, a
change of doctrine, and even a change of established
facts, as nothing. But a change of men we totally
abhor; a change of office, unless in the way of promotion,
we utterly discountenance; and a change from
a majority to a minority we execrate as wholly abominable,
detestable, and in nowise to be endured.
Now, in our creed, men, officers, and majorities make
up the complex idea of what we denominate <i>principle</i>.
The whole scope of the New-Light philosophy is, by
the vigor of this thing <i>principle</i>, as I have defined it,
to keep the Whigs down and our modern school of New-Light
Democrats up. We proudly appeal to our past
history to sustain our consistency in this pursuit. Let
any dispassionate observer trace our meanderings
through the last ten years: he will see the efficacy
of our system manifested in the wonderful, the almost
miraculous conversion of Old Blue-Light Federalists,
and Federalists of every hue, into the Born Veterans
of Democracy, and in investing these worthy relics
of ancient patriotism with the most profitable offices
in the gift of the government. He will see it in the
merciless war&mdash;bellum ad internecionem&mdash;waged by
our forces in the name of the people, against credit,
commerce, and industry: he will remark how abundantly,
and, as it were, by magic, it has fed the nation
upon the economical, and therefore republican food of
promises, relating to a sound currency&mdash;especially those
referring to the gold and silver, while it was stealing
along into the cheap and convenient system of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
government paper in the shape of Treasury notes;
and he will observe, with unfeigned surprise and redoubled
admiration, how effectually it has secured to
us the services and the money of the most opulent individuals
in the land, and of the largest corporations
created by the States&mdash;in a most signal degree those
concerned in public works&mdash;while it preaches against
wealth, chartered privileges and monopolies, and, by
its zeal against them, has enlisted almost every penniless
man, every wasted bankrupt, and every cracked
reputation in the Union upon our side. But we have a
still more illustrious exemplification of the practical
value of our philosophy in the address with which
affairs are managed by the head of the Treasury.</p>

<p>The letter of directions to the Hon. Middleton Flam,
with which my readers have been favored in a previous
chapter, it will be remembered, required the New Lights
to support the Independent Treasury, and as necessary
thereto, to take ground against the State banks, as
altogether unsafe depositories of the public money. It
further intimated, supposing we might be diffident about
this, that the Secretary of the Treasury had already
furnished evidence of this fact, and would, at the
proper time, make it manifest that the Government
had lost more money by the banks than by any other
agents it had ever trusted. Our club had never before
been aware that the Secretary had reversed his old
opinions on this grave question, and we, therefore, lost
no time in making a call upon our member for information.
Great anxiety was felt to possess the Secretary's
views. A substantial vindication of the Independent
Treasury in this aspect, by the overthrow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
the banks on the authority of the man who had built
them up, was a desideratum which we all acknowledged;
and its success we were prepared to regard as the
greatest triumph of the New-Light principle, to be
accomplished through the influence of that matchless
Secretary, "whose mind," as Theodore Fog once
remarked, "was endued with a radiating faculty sufficiently
intense to light up the bottom of a bog, impart
a vitreous translucency to the home of the frog, and
illuminate the abode of the bat with a luster more brilliant
than that which glittered through the boudoirs of
the palace of Aladdin." We were aware that in 1834
his duty required him to prove that the State banks,
while unmolested by the vexatious presence of a bank
of the United States, were the safest of all possible
custodiaries of the people's money; and that it was the
Monster Bank alone which incapacitated them to fulfill
their engagements to the Government&mdash;thence deducing
the fact, that when the monster was dead, the public
funds could be no otherwise than safe in their keeping.
We were aware that at that time it was more particularly
his duty to praise the State banks, because the
unprincipled Whigs denied the fact of their safety, and
opposed the scheme of giving them the public treasure,
on the very ground that the Government had been a
heavy loser by them from the period of the war up to
the date of the charter of the bank. We had read
carefully his report of the 12th of December in that
year, and remembered these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is a remarkable fact connected with this inquiry,
though often represented otherwise, that not a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
selected State bank failed between the expiration of
the old charter and the grant of the new one; and
that none of our losses included in our unavailable
funds happened until some time in 1817, after the
United States Bank was in operation."</p></div>

<p>This, and some other facts culled from the same report,
constituted the armory of weapons by which our
club so manfully fought and prostrated the croaking
and factious Whigs of Quodlibet, when, in their ravings,
they predicted loss from our employment of the pet
banks. But the New Lights being now ordered to take
another tack, and being promised a good fabrication of
facts to fortify our position, we rested on our arms like
soldiers confident in the talents of their general to intrench
them in their new camp, secure against every
charge of the enemy. Mr. Flam lost no time in providing
us with the Secretary's report of February 27th,
1838. That officer did not deceive our hopes. This
luminous paper carried demonstration on its wings and
refutation in its footsteps. Prodigious man! Enormous
functionary! Brightest of ministers! Samson of the
New Lights! Aaron and Moses both in one, of our
Democratic, Quodlibetarian, Golden-calf-worshiping
Israelites, (I speak symbolically, and not in derogation
of the anxiously-looked-for and long-desired Bentonian
coin.) He but touched the rock of New-Light faith,
and forth gushed the facts like water&mdash;yea, and arguments
like milk and water. With what gratulation did
we read,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"The loss to the Treasury by taking depreciated
notes, in 1814, '15, '16, and '17, is estimated at quite
five millions five hundred thousand dollars; and there
is now on hand of such notes then received and never
paid away, or collected, about eighty thousand dollars
more."</p></div>

<p>There was a conclusive argument to all that the
Whigs might have urged in favor of the safety of State
banks, if they had thought proper to defend them;
and, in truth, it was some little mortification to us that
our adversaries did not come out in favor of the banks,
when we were so well provided with facts to put them
down. But they, with that remarkable obstinacy
which has ever characterized them, and which is altogether
behind the age, stuck to their old opinions, and
left us without anything to controvert, except, indeed,
our own facts of 1834.</p>

<p>This instance, however, serves to show with what
majestic bounds the New Lights have passed over the
broad field of measures, and with what facile and graceful
dexterity they have refuted that antiquated and
vulgar adage which stigmatizes facts as stubborn things.
Thus the beauty of this unrivaled philosophy consists
in the harmony with which it reconciles past times with
the present, with which it dovetails discordant principles,
with which it brings into brotherhood elements
the most repulsive, facts the most antagonistical, men
the most variant, and contingencies the most impossible;
which converts every man into a Janus, every
highway into a labyrinth, every beacon into a lighthouse&mdash;giving
to falsehood the value of truth, to
shadow the usefulness of substance, and to concealment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
the estimation of candor. Truly is it the great discovery
of modern times! My reader, I trust, will not,
now that I have opened his understanding to the perception
of this sublime spell-working philosophy, allow
himself henceforth to question the laudable sentiment
of approbation with which I have developed the practical
operation of this theory in the history of Quodlibet.</p>

<p>There was another matter worthy of remark in the
events of the year, which I must cursorily notice before
I proceed to the era with which I propose presently
to occupy my readers. The Presidential election was
now in view, and received that grave consideration
from the members of Congress which they are in the
habit of giving to everything in Washington except
the trifling business of making laws. Our diligent and
watchful representative, some time before the close of
the short session, wrote to our club a letter full of important
advice for our guidance in the affairs of the
approaching canvass for the Presidency.</p>

<p>Among other valuable disclosures, "the Whigs,"
said he, "are to hold a Convention at Harrisburg.
Harry Clay, or, as they term him, Harry of the West,
is to be their man;&mdash;at least, so we suspect. Whoever
he be, we have made up our minds as to our course&mdash;<i>he
is to be run down in the South as an Abolitionist</i>.
Abolition is the best hobby we have had since the death
of the Monster. We have already broken ground;
and if Kendall and Blair can't prove Clay or anybody
else to be an abolitionist, the deuce is in it: their right
hand will have forgotten its cunning. The Globe is
full of the matter already. Tell Eliphalet Fox to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
begin at once and bark in the same key:&mdash;all the little
dogs are expected to yelp after the old hound&mdash;or, as
Pickens calls him, the Galvanized Corpse: many of
them are at it lustily now. In 1836, Van's principles
were luckily Northern;&mdash;so we have resolved to let
them have full swing beyond the Potomac, and to put
him in masquerade for the South. We rely implicitly
on the stolidity of Pennsylvania; and shall secure New
York by a concession to her banks, which for the time
we mean to treat amiably. Our chief aim is the South.
Van, being thoroughly imbued with the New-Light
Quodlibetarian Democracy, has consented, for the
benefit of our cause south of Potomac, to be dubbed
'The Northern man with Southern principles'&mdash;remember
that, and tell Fox to ring the changes on it in
every paper. We have hired a New Hampshire man
to play clown to Van; and he somersets when his
master does. This has a most striking effect. We call
him the mannikin of the North with Southern principles&mdash;Van's
mignonette. Our contract required him
to bring in the anti-abolition resolutions touching the
petitions; and although he could not venture against
<i>the reception</i>, he has bolted down all the rest, <i>totidem
verbis et syllabis</i>, as we wrote them for him;&mdash;<i>the reception</i>
we struck out to accommodate the Democratic
abolitionism of his district. The effect of this coup
d'tat was magical; and having gagged Wise and the rest
of the Whigs with the Previous Question, we have left
them in a state of unnatural retention which threatens
to prove fatal. It is universally considered here a most
lucky hit&mdash;Van and the Mannikin; and we shall, with
these performers, play 'The Northern man with South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>ern
Principles,' to crowded houses. Keep it going!&mdash;and
don't forget, Clay is an Abolitionist. If the Harrisburg
convention nominates anybody else&mdash;the same
paragraphs will suit <i>him</i>;&mdash;Mutato nomine de te fabula
narretur. Get the Secretary to translate that. Be
discreet, and show this letter only to the faithful."</p>

<p>It may readily be imagined that our club was thrown
into ecstacy by this confidential missive. Being the
custodiary of the letter, I have ventured, without the
permission of the club, to incorporate it in these
annals; taking upon myself the risk of their displeasure
rather than withhold so fine a specimen of the
New-Light Quodlibetarian Democracy;&mdash;and indeed I
can see no reason why the world shouldn't have it. We
have no secrets among the New Lights.</p>

<p>I proceed now to the Fourth Era in these annals.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

<p class="chapt-summary smaller">FOURTH ERA&mdash;THE HON. MIDDLETON FLAM RE-ELECTED&mdash;THE NEW
LIGHTS DETERMINE TO STIGMATIZE THE WHIGS AS FEDERALISTS&mdash;MR.
FLAM'S INSTRUCTIONS IN REGARD TO THE PRESIDENTIAL CANVASS&mdash;NOMINATION
OF HARRISON AND TYLER&mdash;COURSE OF THE
NEW LIGHTS&mdash;FORMATION OF THE GRAND CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF
UNFLINCHING NEW-LIGHT QUODLIBETARIAN DEMOCRATS&mdash;ITS PRESIDENT,
SECRETARY, AND PLACE OF MEETING.</p>

<p class="p2">In the autumn of 1839, the Hon. Middleton Flam
was again our candidate for Congress. He was opposed
by the celebrated John Smith, of Thorough Blue.
This contest was marked by one conspicuous feature:
we had completely succeeded in appropriating to our
party the name of Democrats&mdash;at least we had labored
very hard to do so;&mdash;our next move was to get up the
old hue and cry of Federalism against the Whigs.
This required great boldness; but Middleton Flam
entered upon the endeavor with the intrepidity of a
hero. Eliphalet Fox walked in his footsteps, and from
all quarters, simultaneously, and by a well-managed
concert, the cry of Federalist was poured forth upon
our opponents; and Henry Clay especially&mdash;as we
counted on him for the Presidential candidate&mdash;was
proved to be tainted with Federalism beyond all hope
of bleaching it out.</p>

<p>We had now two great points settled with reference
to the canvass for the Presidency: the Whig candidate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
was to be brought into disgrace, first, as an Abolitionist,
and, secondly, as a Federalist. Mr. Flam gave our
club every assurance that these two charges combined
would destroy the purest man that ever lived; and
that it was only necessary to drive these spikes with a
sledgehammer every day, and the Democracy in the
end could not fail to believe in the existence and in the
enormity of these offenses, no matter who should be
brought out by the Whigs&mdash;whether Scott, Clay, Harrison,
or Webster.</p>

<p>But we had pretty conclusively made up our minds
that Clay was to be the man; and our club in consequence
immediately set about procuring the materials
for a biography of that statesman, designed to demonstrate
that he had all his life been a Hartford Conventionist
in sentiment, and an unsparing enemy of Southern
institutions. This task was consigned to Eliphalet
Fox, who very soon amassed a wonderful amount of
matter exactly to our purpose. In this, Eliphalet gave
evidence of his usual skill; and his facts were so contrived
that they might be used with equal success
against either of the four above named, or indeed any
one else who might be brought forward: but as Eliphalet
had a particular hatred for Mr. Clay, and was
more accustomed to defame him than any other great
man in the nation, the compilation was imbued with a
spirit that would have been much more effective in
breaking down Mr. Clay's reputation than that of
either of the others.</p>

<p>Great was the sensation produced in Quodlibet, great
was our mortification, and great our surprise upon receiving
the news in December from Harrisburg. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
convention actually passed by Mr. Clay, passed by the
great claims of Scott and Webster, and brought out
General William Henry Harrison, together with John
Tyler for the Vice-Presidency;&mdash;thus, by a perversity
which, on all important occasions, distinguishes the
Whigs, putting the two old horses of 1836 upon the
course.</p>

<p>Mr. Flam was now at Washington. Our club met
and immediately opened a correspondence with him for
advice. "Keep your eye on the Globe," was his first
admonition. His second was, "Open upon Harrison
your Abolition batteries;&mdash;swear that the nomination
was procured by Garrison;&mdash;charge Tyler with
being a slaveholder, and send that off to New Hampshire;&mdash;prove
that Harrison was a stark Federalist by
accepting an ensigncy from the hands of Washington;&mdash;but,
above all, turn him into derision for his poverty
and plain habits."</p>

<p>It was wonderful to see the zeal with which Quodlibet
set about the task assigned to it by its distinguished
counselor. Eliphalet Fox, with a degree of
magnanimity uncommon in an editor, took the field in
behalf of Mr. Clay. "That persecuted patriot," said
he, "who deserved more of his party than any man in
the nation, has been treated with absolute contempt.
It was due to his great claims to offer him the Presidency;
but the spirit of abolition swayed this factious
convention, and Mr. Clay was rejected solely on account
of his well-known and deep-rooted attachment
to the slave-holding interests of the South. As to
General Harrison," the same article continued, "his
humble station as the clerk of a county court, his in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>significance
and poverty, will leave the Democrats but
little to overcome. Well has an enlightened and patriotic
contemporary press, a distinguished pillar of the
New Lights, remarked, in reference to the habits of
General Harrison's life and the lowness of his associations,
that two thousand dollars a year, a <span class="smcap lowercase">LOG CABIN</span>,
and a barrel of <span class="smcap lowercase">HARD CIDER</span> would induce him to resign
all claims to the honors his inconsiderate friends have
proffered him."</p>

<p>The same paper propounded a series of interrogatories
skillfully addressed to John Tyler, inquiring of
him&mdash;what number of slaves he employed on his plantation,
what was the ratio of their increase in each
year, and how many he had disposed of at various intervals
to Southern traders:&mdash;which interrogatories
were admirably drawn up in language so equivocal in
its import as to infer, what it did not directly assert,
an extensive traffic in a commodity which could not but
excite great indignation against him among the large
mass of voters of all sides in the North.</p>

<p>How beautiful are these evidences of the operation
of our New-Light philosophy! What a master in this
science is the unrivaled Eliphalet Fox!</p>

<p>It was soon discovered that our club had fallen into
a slight mistake touching the Log Cabin and Hard
Cider, and the charge of poverty brought against General
Harrison. The audacious Whigs had even the
effrontery to adopt the <span class="smcap lowercase">LOG CABIN</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">HARD CIDER</span>
as the emblem of their party, and to ask the aid of
those whom we had inconsiderately derided for living
in those humble cabins and using this cheap luxury of
cider, to make war against our New-Light Democracy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
The Log Cabin instantly became the representative of
a sentiment and a word of power; and, in a perfect
tornado of enthusiasm, was raised in every village,
hamlet, and meeting ground in the land.</p>

<p>Truly did this sudden upraising of the emblem
strike dismay into our ranks! Quid consilii capiemus?
was our universal question in Quodlibet. What should
we do? Recourse was had to Mr. Flam. "Drop,"
said that ready-witted man in reply, "the charge of
poverty against Harrison: say he is rolling in wealth.
Bring out your Federalism against him with new vigor.
Call the Log Cabin banner senseless mummery&mdash;and
declare your disgust against it, as lowering the tone
of public sentiment and morals. If that doesn't do,
get some New-Light Democratic preacher to say that
Hard Cider produces more intoxication than all the
liquors the Democrats ever drank: let him rail against
Whig meetings as Hard Cider orgies&mdash;remember the
word;&mdash;and if we can only identify the New-Light
Democracy with Temperance, its twin sister, we shall
produce an unheard-of effect. Meantime, ply the
Abolition battery with all possible diligence&mdash;and vamp
up anew that old charge of hiring out criminals to service;
but be careful to make no mistake&mdash;describe it
as 'selling poor white men into slavery for debt.' To
prove that Harrison is <i>against</i> slavery and at the same
time <i>in favor</i> of it, will be a most happy stroke of our
New-Light Quodlibetarian philosophy. Don't fail to
do this with all possible industry. Tell Eliphalet Fox
that the endeavor is worthy of his genius, and if he
ever expects to become a great man, now is the opportunity
presented to him."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>These counsels gave us great encouragement, and we
set ourselves to work in earnest. The New-Light Club
was confined in its operations to the Borough of Quodlibet.
Our whole Congressional district, including
Thorough Blue, Tumbledown, and Bickerbray, required
the supervision of a body which might be organized to
regulate the affairs of the canvass within that limit.
This gave rise to the Central Committee. A convention
was called to meet in Quodlibet, where every portion
of the district should be represented. That convention
resulted in the appointment of a Committee of
Twelve of the staunchest and most active of the New
Lights. It was called "The Grand Central Committee
of Unflinching New-Light Quodlibetarian Democrats."
The name was sonorous, euphonious, and, in a certain
sense, magnificent&mdash;but being too long for ordinary use,
we reduced it for working purposes to "The Great
New-Light Democratic Central Committee of Quodlibet."
Eliphalet Fox was made President; and the
humble author of these chronicles, in consideration of
his fidelity in the discharge of his duty to the New-Light
Club, was chosen to be Secretary also of the
committee&mdash;an honor which, with due reverence and
thankfulness, he hath assumed.</p>

<p>From the date of its organization, the committee, a
majority whereof are inhabitants of Quodlibet, meet
once a week with most commendable punctuality, and,
as we have reason to believe, with signal usefulness to
the glorious cause in which we have embarked. Zachary
Younghusband, who is a member, gratuitously and
generously, out of his mere zeal in the cause, proffered
the use of his room up stairs above the tin-plate work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>shop,
for our sessions&mdash;an offer which we were reluctantly
obliged to decline, after one trial, on account of
the noise created by the workmen below. I mention
this praiseworthy offer as due to Zachary, in favor of
whom the committee passed a vote of thanks. We
found a more quiet place of meeting in the back room
of the cabinet store of Isaiah Crape, the Undertaker,
for which we agreed to pay fifty cents a week and find
our own lights. In this secluded spot much is done to
shape and direct the destinies of this Great Republic.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

THE COMPILATION OF THESE ANNALS.</p>

<p class="p2">The Grand Central Committee having been thus
happily organized, devoted itself with exemplary diligence
to the important concerns of the Presidential
election, which, from this time forth, became the engrossing
subject of all men's thoughts. A volume
would not suffice to develop the multifarious labors of
the committee. I could not in less space recount the
resolutions, with long argumentative preambles, linking
by means of Whereases, like rings, whole newspaper
loads of facts, invented for the purpose;&mdash;the addresses,
the speeches copied from the Globe, and extracts from
private letters&mdash;to say nothing of the paragraphs, the
sole offspring of editorial brains, and all the other
machinery employed by the committee to defame, traduce,
and vilify General Harrison, for the unpardon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>able
sin of being thought by the Whigs a fit man to
preside over this vast Republic. It was our duty to
render, if possible, his very name offensive in the nostrils
of the people. In this endeavor it may easily be
imagined that we found abundance to do in rummaging
up old scraps of history, the falsification of public
records, the oblique interpretation of equivocal laws,
and in practicing all the other customary arts of warfare
known to the New-Light tactics.</p>

<p>Admirable is that wisdom of the New Democracy
which has provided such an ordeal of punishment for
the man who, in opposition to their wishes, dares to
make claim to the favor of the people. What better
chastisement can be inflicted upon such rash aspirant,
than this preliminary gauntlet which it is ordained for
him to run before he can be made sensible of the insolence
of his pretensions? Thrice tormented is it his
lot to be, in the fiery furnace of hatred, malice, and all
uncharitableness, before he shall see the end of his vain
probation. As certain tribes of Indians have a custom
of torturing, to the verge of stoutest human endurance,
the candidate for the honor of being accounted a Brave;
so in imitation of this commendable usage did we determine,
in no less degree, to torture the man whom the
hardihood of the Whigs had placed before the nation
for the like empty and unavailing honor.</p>

<p>It did truly seem to the New Lights no small insolence
of those men who call themselves Whigs, to propose
any individual for the Presidency, while the
people were already favored with a chief whose whole
life was lustrous with the radiance of the Quodlibetarian
Democracy. The very idea of a New Light pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>supposes
an innate, inherent, and intuitive fitness to
fill any station of any kind or degree whatever; and
here was one distinguished as the very fountain of New-Light
principles already at the head of the nation, dispensing
the favors and wielding the power of his great
office to the supreme content of all Quodlibetarians&mdash;the
only persons in this Republic whose interests
deserve to be held of any account in the concerns of
government. Nothing but the rankest faction could
originate an opposition to his beneficent administration.
Acting upon this conviction, the Central Committee
certainly did not spare General Harrison.</p>

<p>It was, however, soon perceived that the General
was a little stronger with the people than we supposed
him to be; and sundry were the changes to which we
were consequently obliged to resort in our mode of attack.
The <i>abolitionism</i> we never lost sight of: the
<i>selling of white men into slavery for debt</i> was also a
steady topic; and some of the more ingenious of the
committee fell upon the device of proving the old General
<i>a coward</i>: but our great effort was to convert him
and all his friends into old Blue-Light <i>Federalists</i>.
This was always considered our master-stroke; and I
may appeal to all the New-Light papers of this day for
evidence, that in that department of our labors we plied
our task with an industry that has never been surpassed.
The Jersey election, also, we turned to great account in
Congress, and certainly blew our trumpet on that question
both loud and long. It was a noble illustration of
our zeal for State Rights, which all the world knows is
one of the favorite articles in our present faith. With
an eye to this same question of State Rights, we suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>ceeded
in getting up a tolerable good commotion in
Congress on the subject of State debts; holding it our
duty, as friends of the sovereignty of the States, to do
all in our power to break down their credit, and to
warn the world against placing any confidence in their
pledges&mdash;although, upon this subject, I am bound to
confess that our success has not answered our expectations.</p>

<p>There was one movement upon which our committee
placed great reliance. Mr. Van Buren, and indeed the
whole New-Light Democracy, had so often changed
their course upon public measures, as I have already
shown, that the nation had been by degrees brought
into a belief that every public man was, of necessity,
and from the very nature of his organization, bound to
certify, at least once a year, the state of his principles
and the character of his opinions on all questions of
policy whatever. Now Mr. Van Buren, in 1836, came
to the Presidency upon a very summary, and to himself,
very comfortable profession of faith. All that he
professed at that time was to follow in the footsteps&mdash;which
said footsteps had scope and variation enough
to allow him to take any path he thought proper.
General Harrison, in that contest of 1836, did not
enjoy this advantage, but was compelled to be somewhat
specific in the indication of the grounds upon
which his election claimed to be based. He had,
consequently, not only been very full in this exposition,
but had likewise referred his interrogators to a vast
amount of written and printed opinions, which on
divers occasions, in the course of his public career, he
had found reason to express.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>In the present canvass it was determined by our committee,
and in fact by our New-Light friends in general,
that he should reiterate afresh everything he had ever
said or written on public matters, and that we should,
by no means, be content with mere references to past
declarations. Indeed, it seemed to our New-Light
Democracy that, inasmuch as <i>our</i> President kept no
opinions more than three years old, at the outside, it
was impossible that General Harrison could be so antiquated
as to stick to his for a longer term. Confiding
in this impression, plans were laid by the New Lights
to write letters to the General in the guise of friends,
and in case he should refer the querists to his former
expositions, without full and ample repetition of all he
had said before, to bring a whirlwind of indignant
reproof about his ears as a man who was afraid to trust
the public with his sentiments. This stratagem succeeded
beyond the most sanguine expectation of the
New Lights. The General was caught in the trap;
and such a clamor as was raised has never before been
known in any part of the world.</p>

<p>"He won't answer questions!" exclaimed the Globe.
"Gracious Heaven! what an insult to the intelligence
of a nation of vigilant, truth-seeking, anxiously-inquiring
freemen! A silent candidate! What contumely
to the people! What contempt of the fundamental
principles of free government!"</p>

<p>"Gracious Heaven! what contempt of the people!"
re-echoed the Quodlibet Whole Team.</p>

<p>"Gracious Heaven! what contumely!" shouted the
Bickerbray Scrutinizer.</p>

<p>"Gracious Heaven!" etc. etc., ejaculated two thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>sand
patriotic, disciplined, footstep-following papers of
all dimensions, from six by twelve to three feet square,
from one end of the Union to the other. Never was
there such a Gracious Heavening carried on in this
country!</p>

<p>In the midst of all this successively came on the
Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Virginia elections. The
results everybody knows. Although ostensibly and to
outward appearance against us, we saw in them what
our infatuated opponents could not see, the certain
token of our success. It was evident to us, from the
returns of these elections, that a great reaction must
occur; and Mr. Doubleday now very sagely remarked,
"that there was no longer room to doubt that we
should beat the Whigs in the fall." But the Whigs,
instead of desponding at these events, began to take
heart, and straightway set about getting up a Convention
in Baltimore. Well, that convention was held on
the Fourth of May. I was present, and I pronounce
it to have been a <i>thorough failure</i>. The Whigs have
represented that at least twenty thousand persons
were assembled on that occasion. According to the
accurate system of computation adopted by the New
Lights, and which is infallible in regard to the numbers
attending Whig meetings, the whole assemblage, including
boys and blacks, did not quite reach two
thousand, and of those a large number were New
Lights.</p>

<p>Still it is due to truth that I should say there were
some timid men in our committee who were not altogether
satisfied with the appearances of the day. We
found it difficult to make them comprehend how the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
late elections had operated in our favor. Yet it is a
fact that we never were thoroughly convinced of the
<i>certainty</i> of our success until we saw the returns in
these elections. Connecticut and Rhode Island we had
before considered doubtful: we now had no doubt. And
as to Virginia, we became at once fully persuaded that
our success there was actually "brilliant:"&mdash;such is the
beautiful operation of the New-Light philosophy in
bringing consolation to its votaries under apparent disaster,
and suggesting encouragement where others
would despond.</p>

<p>Yet it must not be concealed that these incidents
produced some slight sensation in our committee. Mr.
Flam wrote from Washington a letter of grave reflection.
"Although," said he, "our success in Virginia
has transcended our expectations, yet we are not quite
certain that our <i>abolition</i> battery has been altogether
<i>very effective</i>. Indeed, it is questioned here whether
it would not be as well to abandon it, and even point
the guns in the opposite direction. <i>Martin has room
enough yet to turn</i>&mdash;and, as it is rather manifest that
Virginia considers our charge of abolitionism against
Harrison a <i>humbug</i>, and as the whole South will
probably fall into the same opinion, (in which, in my
judgment, they would not be very far wrong,) the
propriety of taking the opposite ground is well worthy
of consideration. <i>Van's affinities are with the North</i>;
so that if it can be made clearly to appear to be his
interest to take this backward leap, his <i>Southern principles</i>
are not yet more than cobwebs in his way. <i>We
must think of this.</i> In the mean time, it is the desire
of the President and his managing friends here that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
you not only continue to brand the opposition as
<i>Federalists</i>, but call them <span class="smcap">British Whigs</span>. This is
rendered necessary by the fact that the opposition have
just discovered that Van Buren voted against Madison
and the War, and supported Clinton and the Peace
party. By anticipating the ground and charging the
Whigs as under British influence, we shall take off the
edge of this assault, and avoid the effect of another
reminiscence against the President&mdash;I mean his instructions
to M'Lane, on the West India Question,
which the Whigs impute to him as a truckling to Great
Britain. Besides this, you know, Martin has been
very assiduous of late in courting the good opinion of
Victoria&mdash;so, by all means, drive at <span class="smcap">The British
Whigs</span>! Keep your eye upon Amos Kendall, who has
consented to act as fugleman. His health is so much
shattered by the diseases of the Post-office, that he
is compelled to retire; and as his physician prescribes
'the excitement of composition' as his only cure, he
is about to devote himself to the Extra Globe, in which
sheet he will be able to indulge his imagination in the
creation of those chaste and prurient fancies for which
he has been remarkable from a child. The pure and
simple inventions of that paper are ass's milk to his
wasted constitution."</p>

<p>Thus admonished, our Central Committee proceeded
in their labors with the most spirited activity;
and it was not long before the whole Union was
ringing with our charge against the British Whigs.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that I suggested to the
committee the propriety of making this compilation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
of the Annals of Quodlibet. I explained to them how
important it was that the world should be made acquainted
with the history and character of that New-Light
philosophy which had worked such wonders in
our Borough. It was very obvious that even our
friends were not fully aware of the height and the
depth of this sublime theory, nor of its extreme
efficacy in the administration of the government.
It had taken the world by surprise, and had grown
up, in a few years, into a system which no naturalist
had yet defined; and had assumed an importance
in the affairs of this country which few persons were
able fully to appreciate. Impressed with this conviction,
I disclosed to the committee the purpose
which, for some time past, I had secretly cherished,
of collating from my manuscripts all such particulars
in the history of Quodlibet as might serve to elucidate
this subject. The committee knew that my materials
were ample; and they had more than once been
pleased to express their admiration of those poor
talents which I had oftentimes exhibited in the effusions
of my humble pen. The subject was now
brought up to the notice of the committee on the
motion of my friend, Mr. Younghusband, in a resolution
too laudatory for my modesty to insert in this
book. Readily and cheerfully did the committee
condescend to assign this task to my endeavors;&mdash;confiding
the matter and the manner thereof to my
sole discretion, with the single injunction that I should
abstain from all such incidents of mere personal or
private concernment, as might by captious or in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>vidious
critics be designated as savoring of romance.
Faithfully, as in my judgment, I could, have I obeyed
this injunction; and with the frankness and veracity
of one who chronicles for posterity rather than the
present times, have I set forth all such matters of fact
and comments of opinion as shall guide my readers to
a true knowledge of the doctrine of the New-Light
Quodlibetarian philosophy.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>

<p class="chapt-summary smaller">DESERVED COMPLIMENT ON MR. VAN BUREN'S EXPLOIT OF THE
FLORIDA WAR&mdash;THE AFFAIR OF THE TRUE GRITS AND SERGEANT
TRAP&mdash;TRUE GRITS SUFFER A DEFEAT&mdash;FLAN SUCKER'S OPINION
UPON THE SUBJECT&mdash;HIS ACCOUNT OF AN ACTION AT LAW BETWEEN
JOE SNARE AND IKE SWINGLETREE.</p>

<p class="p2">Just at this period the True Grits once more began
to give themselves airs of importance in Quodlibet.
The Tigertail affair had stunned them, as a blow sometimes
torpifies a snake; and like that same snake,
which after a long period of consequent inactivity
wakes up in the possession of new powers of mischief,
so woke up the True Grits.</p>

<p>The Florida war, which has been raging on the part
of the Indians, and simmering on our part, for nearly
five years past, is undoubtedly the greatest of all Mr.
Van Buren's exploits, and that which will be longest
remembered in the history of this energetic President
by posterity. It has developed the genius of our New-Light
Democratic administration in stronger colors,
and speaks more conclusively in favor of the perseverance
and resource of our Great Chief, than any
other of the numerous brilliant acts whereby he has
illustrated the principles of that unterrified and unflinching
Democracy, to whom fortune and General
Jackson in partnership, have intrusted the destinies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
of this Republic. That war was not only the most
righteous and unavoidable in its origin, but it has also
been the most chivalrous in its character, the most
economical in its management, and is likely to be the
most productive in its results&mdash;if it should ever please
Bill Jumper, or Sam Jones, or Micanopy, or their
heirs and representatives, to allow it to come to a conclusion&mdash;that
has ever been waged between two great
nations; and will unquestionably cover our Commander-in-chief
of the army and navy of the United States
with as thick a coat of glory as it has already covered
the bravest and keenest-nosed of our bloodhounds with
a coat of mud:&mdash;and that is, perhaps, about as thick a
covering as a hero of the President's mould might be
supposed able to stagger under, in that long journey
of fame by which he is to march down to after-times.</p>

<p>Among other vigorous measures taken in the prosecution
of this stupendous war, was one that produced
no small sensation in Quodlibet. A tall, raw-boned,
slender, and very straight figure of a man, of a singularly
red head and remarkably freckled face&mdash;the said
figure being decked in a suit of army regimentals
highly bedizened with worsted lace and cord, begirt
with a huge saber, and wearing a plume three feet long&mdash;made
its appearance recently in the Borough. This
personage rejoiced in the name and title of Sergeant
Trap. He was accompanied by a drummer four feet
six inches high, of a remarkably fierce military aspect;
and by a fifer six feet four, quite as remarkable for the
length of his arms and legs, and the shortness of his
sleeves and pantaloons&mdash;both inferring, from their
general effect upon his exterior, a rustical and imbel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>licose
mode of life which reluctantly accommodated
itself to the military requisitions of his station.</p>

<p>The Sergeant and drummer were strangers to our
folks; but the fifer was no other than Charley Moggs,
long known as the boss loafer of Bickerbray, and who
was famed for a <i>single</i> accomplishment&mdash;the perfection
with which he executed, upon an octave flute, that
difficult but favorite piece of music which goes by the
name of "Sugar in a Gourd;" which accomplishment
was the foundation of his present astonishing promotion
under Sergeant Trap, who had come to Quodlibet,
in pursuance of orders from Mr. Poinsett, to pick up as
many spare heroes for the Florida war, as might be
found in our environs, willing to dog the Indians in
company with our gallant blood-hound allies lately
arrived from Cuba.</p>

<p>The Sergeant took a small frame house next door to
Sim Travers's Refectory&mdash;or rather, as Sim called it,
his Drinkery. Here he hung out the stars and stripes,
by a pole which was secured in the second story window,
and from which the flag vibrated in graceful undulations,
almost sweeping the street when the wind
lulled, and filling the hearts of Sim Travers's customers
with emotions of martial glory.</p>

<p>Now, Sergeant Trap had not the good fortune to be
a New Light; but, on the contrary, had the misfortune
to be perfectly neutral in politics&mdash;and, coupled with
that, the additional misfortune to be sometimes in want
of money. In the course of some two or three weeks
residence in the Borough, he had contracted a sort of
intimacy with Peter Ounce, the landlord of The Boatman's
Hotel at the upper end, and on the opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
side of the Basin. This intimacy mainly grew out of
the circumstance that Ounce's hotel furnished very
pleasant quarters to the Sergeant, and had also contributed
some five or six recruits to his standard. Peter
Ounce, although a Whig, is a kind-hearted, sociable
man, and disposed to make friendships with those about
him; and the Sergeant having run up a score at the
bar, fell into the relation of a debtor to Peter, which
it was not always convenient for him, at a moment, to
obliterate. Besides this, Sergeant Trap had, once or
twice, borrowed small sums from the landlord, and received
from him sundry manifestations of good-will,
which laid him, in a certain sense, under obligations to
Peter. The result of it all was, that the Sergeant took
a great liking to his landlord&mdash;and, following the suggestions
of that feeling, rather encouraged his men,
when they had a little money to spend in slaking their
thirst, to throw it in the way of Ounce.</p>

<p>This state of things existed for some time before it
was brought into public observation. Ounce's liquors
were good and cheap, the company about his hotel was
jovial, and Peter himself obliging&mdash;in consequence of
all which Sergeant Trap's men went as often to the
Boatman's Hotel as they did to Sim Travers's Drinkery,
which was next door to the rendezvous. Sim Travers,
who always kept a sharp eye to his business, was the
first to notice the visits of Trap's men to his rival's
bar, and for some time he bore it with a sulky and
uneasy silence. After awhile, sundry inarticulate
murmurs escaped him denoting vexation; and at length
he openly began to shake his head and talk about <i>the
duty</i> of soldiers and officers <i>in the employ</i> of the Gov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>ernment.
"<i>We</i> work for the Government," said he,
"and the Government ought to work for <i>us</i>. If public
money <i>is</i> to be laid out, them that goes through fire
and water has the best claim. These Whigs are ready
enough to touch the cash when there's profit to be got;
while them that sticks by Government in all their
eternal choppings and changings is to be lookers-on.
To the Wieters belongs the Spiles; if that ain't a
motter, what's the use of having it? Go it full, or give
it up&mdash;that's what I say."</p>

<p>Sim continued to repeat these sentiments for some
time, without seeing things alter for the better. Peter
Ounce still continued to divide the profits of the rendezvous
with him. At last Sim became violent. "I'll
make it a committee matter," said be. Thereupon he
went immediately to Eliphalet Fox, and opened to him
his whole burden of grievances. "I'll fix it," replied
Fox, very much in the tone of a man of business; and
Sim went home in excellent spirits.</p>

<p>The next Whole Hog had a paragraph touching this
subject. "If," said that paper, "there be one principle
which has been more sacredly established than
any other by that great revolution through which we
have just conducted the nation, in redeeming it from
the oppressions of Monopolists and Privileged orders,
it is the deep and fundamental truth that, To those who
have won the victory belong its fruits. The Democracy
have an unalienable and indefeasible right to all
emoluments, issues, and profits accruing from the expenditures
of the public money. And, moreover, if
there be any class of persons who emphatically <i>belong</i>
to the Government, it is the men who are enlisted for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
the Florida war. Few of them are destined ever to
return again to the character of citizens: their <i>lives</i>
are undoubtedly the property of the administration, as
every man must see who reflects upon the history of
that war. And if their <i>lives</i> are thus devoted to the
cause of the administration, much more, may it be said,
are their <i>little gains</i> to be employed in the same cause.
Notwithstanding this self-evident truth, we know of
men now in this Borough, wearing the livery of the
Government, who do not scruple to enrich the coffers
of the British Whigs with the money lavished upon
them by the bounty of the Government, and which has
been wrung from the sweat of the poor man's brow.
We trust we shall be understood, without being more
explicit. If this abuse continue after this hint, we
shall act in a more efficient form:&mdash;a word to the
wise."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this very significant paragraph, and
the fact that the paper containing it was sent to the
rendezvous, and even addressed to Sergeant Trap by
name, the practice complained of was in no degree
corrected. On the contrary, as if from sheer perverseness
and contumacy, the evil, if anything, was
rather increased. Eliphalet Fox waited a few days to
see how his paragraph worked. Sim Travers came to
him with a face now much more in anger than in grief.
"It doesn't work at all," said Eliphalet, adverting to
his paragraph, and anticipating Sim's complaint.
"Never mind, my friend," continued he, "this is <i>my</i>
quarrel. Go home: leave all to me!"</p>

<p>Sim went home, confident that he should have ample
redress. "If I don't get it," said he, as he walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
toward the Drinkery, ruminating over his wrongs,
"blow me if I don't quit the party. I'm not one of
them fools to go thorough-stitch, and get nothing for
it&mdash;blow me!"</p>

<p>"I'll see justice done to Sim Travers," said Eliphalet
Fox, with an atrabilious look, when he was left
alone, "or die in the attempt&mdash;blast me!"</p>

<p>After this blowing and blasting, Sim went about the
Borough telling every man of the persecution he was
suffering from the Whigs; and Eliphalet Fox went
about to get up the old Tigertail Convention and bring
the matter before them.</p>

<p>The next evening the convention met, and a Secret
Committee was raised with instructions to write a
<i>lettre de cachet</i> to the President, explaining the flagitious
conduct of Sergeant Trap, and demanding his
immediate dismissal from the army. This letter was
written by Eliphalet Fox, and was signed by him and
William Goodlack, besides Sim Travers and Thomas
Crop the constable, which two latter made their mark&mdash;these
four being the Secret Committee. The letter
was duly dispatched to Washington to be presented by
the Hon. Middleton Flam, who was <i>required</i> by the
committee to render this service, from a suspicion that
at bottom he was not very favorable to the True Grits.
"Catch a weasel asleep!" said our worthy representative
when this letter reached him. "Gentlemen, I'll
do your bidding, by all means." And so, being wide
awake, and fully determined to give the True Grits no
cause of complaint against him, he went straight with
the <i>lettre de cachet</i> to the President. In a few days the
committee received a letter from Mr. Flam, informing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
them he had done everything they had demanded:
that the President had read their confidential communication,
and without hesitation replied, that if
Sergeant Trap had been a <i>civil</i> officer, he would have
dismissed him without further inquiry, in deference to
the respectability of the committee;&mdash;but that, as
Sergeant Trap belonged to the <i>army</i>, he found himself
reluctantly compelled to proceed in a more formal
manner, and that consequently he should direct a Military
Court of Inquiry to take cognizance of the case:
that this Court would sit in Quodlibet where the prosecutors
were requested to be ready to prove the enormities
alleged against Sergeant Trap.</p>

<p>"A Court of Inquiry!" exclaimed Fox, with great
emotion. "Is the thing to be made public? We are
deceived, betrayed:&mdash;I know by whom," he added,
significantly nodding his head.</p>

<p>"A Court of Inquiry!&mdash;proofs, and all riglar&mdash;upon
oath?" exclaimed Sim Travers.</p>

<p>"I'm blest if I go before any court!" said Tom Crop.</p>

<p>"By blazes, I won't!" said Billy Goodlack. "There's
<i>something</i> in this here thing&mdash;else why don't the President
go smack forward on the letter?"</p>

<p>"I'm no prosecutor," said Eliphalet Fox.</p>

<p>"I'm not a persecutor, nother," said Tom Crop. "By
blood! I scorn it."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to put my hand on the book, upon
it," said Sim Travers. "If a man can't lodge a complaint
without being hauled into court, the party's
broke: a fig for the money! who cares about it?"</p>

<p>"That's my identical sentiment!" said Billy Goodlack.
"By blazes, I'm no prosecutioner!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>The committee was certainly thrown into great consternation.
The cause of this is said to have been that
in representing the case of Sergeant Trap to the President
by letter, upon which they expected an immediate
order dismissing the offender from service, they had
charged him with a long list of misdemeanors against
the welfare of the Great New-Light Democratic Party;
which they knew, in the first place, had no sort of
foundation in fact, and therefore might be found extremely
difficult of proof; and the attempt to investigate
which, in the second place, they were aware might
bring the True Grits into collision with each other in a
manner not very conducive to the harmony of the party.
They were, therefore, not a little thrown aback when
they were apprised of the President's determination to
make the charges a subject of inquiry.</p>

<p>We cannot sufficiently commend Mr. Van Buren's
caution in this matter, and the sound New-Light Democratic
view he took of the subject. Here was a grave
charge preferred against one of his own servants, imputing
to him a disposition to deal with Whigs&mdash;nay,
an <i>actual</i> dealing with them, when there was a New
Light to be found in the same town capable of furnishing
the same commodity. Doubtless, upon this nefarious
transaction being fully proved, Mr. Van Buren,
like a genuine, unadulterated Quod, as he is, would
dismiss the offender from service, or even inflict on him
other punishment, if it fell in his way. But in so
serious a case he was determined not to be premature
in his action: he would not proceed&mdash;unless, indeed,
the offender had been a civil officer&mdash;upon such testimony
as the confidential letter of a committee. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
takes the only just course&mdash;(in this I have reason to
believe he was fully seconded, perhaps even prompted,
by our sagacious representative, the Hon. Middleton
Flam)&mdash;and that is a formal, solemn, judicial inquiry
into the conduct of Sergeant Trap, to ascertain whether
he <i>really had</i> purchased liquors to the prejudice of the
Great New-Light Quodlibetarian Democratic Party.
Truly have we reason, day by day, to rejoice in a
President of such magnanimity, such justice, such innate
republicanism, and withal such dignity!</p>

<p>The Court of Inquiry met. It was composed of
officers of high rank. After a long and patient investigation,
and the most accurate ascertainment of the
number of gills of rum, whisky, and brandy sold to
Trap's recruits by Sim Travers, and by Peter Ounce,
and a careful arithmetical computation of the value
thereof in money; and, after a laborious examination
into Sim Travers's politics, as also into those of Peter
Ounce, the trial resulted in the conclusion that Sim
Travers was not so good a New Light as he professed
to be, (this was founded on evidence that Sim had said
"he would leave the party if he couldn't get his share
of spiles,") and that Peter Ounce's politics were, in
fact, not known to Sergeant Trap at the time he dealt
with him: whereupon Trap was acquitted of each and
every charge brought against him; although Theodore
Fog, the Counsel for the Secret Committee, took upon
himself to inform the Sergeant, somewhat authoritatively,
that as he was now aware of the dangerous
tendency of Ounce's principles, the President would
expect him to close all accounts at the said Peter's bar,
and to be more circumspect the next time.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>It was generally admitted, and indeed was the common
talk of the Borough, that in this notable trial
Eliphalet Fox dodged, that Billy Goodlack dodged, that
Sim Travers dodged, and that Tom Crop actually
skulked. And the general effect of the whole was to
cut the combs of the True Grits so thoroughly, that it
is believed they will never rise again. Flan Sucker
made a jest of this, very much to the annoyance of his
friends&mdash;for Flan had taken a violent fancy to Sergeant
Trap, and even at one time, it was supposed, had an
idea of enlisting. He used to sit up with the Sergeant
of nights and drink a good deal with him through the
day, and by this means very naturally became quite a
crony. He therefore exulted much more than a True
Grit, it was conceived, ought, at the Sergeant's triumphant
acquittal. "Sargeant Trap," said he, "Locumsgillied
Liphlet Fox;" and as this expression
requires an explanation, he gave it, to this effect.</p>

<p>"Joe Snare, the bailiff over here in Tumbledown,
fotch a suit before Squire Honeywell, agin Ike Swingletree
for twenty-five dollars, on a cart which Joe sold
him. Joe drawed up a note of hand for Ike to sign,
which Ike did; and Ike never thought no more about
it. Joe kept askin' for his money, year after year,
year after year, tell at last he got tired, and so fotch
the suit. Ike found out at the trial that the Squire
was goin' to give judgment agin him; so what does he
do but sashrary the case!&mdash;whereby the case was tuck
up to the Court. Well, when they came on to trial
there, Ike had a lawyer who found out that the note
of hand was more than three years old, and there
hadn't been no promise to pay in the mean time. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>upon
the Court told Joe Snare, if he hadn't nothing to
say agin' it, they must give judgment for Ike on the
Statute of Lamentations. Is it that, your honor? said
Snare&mdash;for Joe being bailiff was pretty well up to law,
and pled his own cause;&mdash;well, may it please your
honor, maybe the statue is agin me, but, your honor, I
drawed up the note of hand myself, and if you'll just
be so kind to look in the corner under the dog's-ear,
you'll see two letters at the eend of Ike Swingletree's
name tantamount to L. S., which, as I understand,
your honor, goes for <i>Locumsgilly</i>&mdash;whereby it takes
twelve years, if I'm not mistaken, to kill the note of
hand, bekase that's a bond. The judge looked and
looked, and then sot up a laugh; and Ike Swingletree
began to turn a little pale. Joe, says the judge, you're
right, says he: that alters the case, and you must have
the judgment. Joe, says he, you have beaten the
lawyer and his client both&mdash;you're a clever fellow, and
will get your money. So Joe accordingly got the
judgment, and came off mightily pleased. And when
he was tellin' me about the matter next day, he burst
out in a great haw-haw, and couldn't hardly talk for
laughing: Ike Swingletree, said he, sashraried <i>me</i>, but
I reckon I Locumsgillied <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>"Well, that's just what Sergeant Trap has done to
Liphlet Fox&mdash;<span class="smcap">Locumsgillied</span> him beautiful."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

FLAM&mdash;DEFECTION OF FOG AND SUNDRY TRUE GRITS&mdash;SECOND
SPLIT&mdash;GREAT UPROAR AND CONFUSION.</p>

<p class="p2">My patient and indulgent reader will doubtless agree
with me that it is time these gossiping chronicles were
brought to a close. Indeed, I am so near upon the
heels of the day in which I write, and the printer so
near upon mine, that little remains to be said. I shall
therefore dispatch what remains of my memoranda
with such speed as shall suit my reader's longing for
the end.</p>

<p>Although the New Lights in general bore no ill-will
against that division or faction which has been distinguished
in these pages by the name of True Grits,
yet I must say we were not wholly displeased at the
result of Serjeant Trap's trial. On the contrary, many
of us chuckled in secret thereat. Eliphalet Fox we
have ever acknowledged to be a useful man and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
zealous&mdash;and we have not been backward to award
him such meed as he deserved. But it must be told
that in Eliphalet there lurks a scantling of ambition
to climb higher on the ladder than our party is yet
willing to afford to one of his degree. And Eliphalet
moreover is suspected&mdash;Heaven forfend that I should
do him wrong!&mdash;in regard to the Hon. Middleton Flam
our representative, and those who are not altogether
well disposed toward him, I mean Theodore Fog's adherents,
(for it is manifest Theodore is looking to a seat
in Congress,) utrosque parietes linere, as the Latin
proverb has it, which in the vernacular signifies to wear
two faces&mdash;by no means an uncommon, though a very
objectionable sin in political affairs. This may be a
groundless suspicion, as I would fain hope it is; but it
is believed by many, and therefore the more reason
was there for some secret rejoicing in Quodlibet at
Eliphalet's failure in the matter of Sim Travers. It
unquestionably hath made our editor of the Whole
Hog more modest and seemly in his behavior of
late.</p>

<p>The course of the canvass has been growing every
day more and more intensely interesting to our New
Lights; and, bating some few aberrations into which
we have fallen, daily gives us greater promise of the
consummation of all our wishes. The passage of the
Independent Treasury bill has brought us fresh occasion
of rejoicing and confidence. After a long, and, as
Tom Crop says, a bloody struggle, lo! it is at last the
law of the land, and all our wishes are crowned. "It
is," as Mr. Flam has declared, "the unmingled, unaided,
spontaneous result of popular sagacity&mdash;spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>ing
not from executive dictation, nor the influence of
party discipline, but from the intuitive and instinctive
wisdom of millions of freemen ground to the dust by
the tyrannical pressure of associated wealth. It is the
law of the land in spite of the groans of merchants,
the wailings of agriculturists, and the murmurs of mechanics.
It seals the fortune of our great chief, and
proclaims the immortal triumph of the New-Light
Democracy."</p>

<p>When the tidings of this joyful event reached us in
Quodlibet, our first care was to fire one hundred guns;
the next was to illuminate the Borough, and to bring
out all our flags and lanterns; after this the New
Lights were called together in the Court-House, where
addresses were delivered by Agamemnon Flag and
Theodore Fog&mdash;the latter of whom actually outdid
himself in an effort that would have exalted the fame
of Patrick Henry; and to close this jubilee, the Central
Committee passed a resolution declaring the bill
the Second Declaration of Independence. For this
brilliant series of events we have to thank that sturdy
devotion to State Rights which shone with such conspicuous
luster in the annihilation of New Jersey by
the New Lights, in the House of Representatives.
But for that glorious stroke of policy the bill would
again have been crushed by the serpent of opposition.
Now that we have gained it, British Federal Whiggery
is forever prostrate.</p>

<p>A fortnight after this event brought us the cheering
tidings from Louisiana, to which many an anxious eye
had been turned. The elections there have resulted in
a splendid victory&mdash;a victory, indeed, not indicated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
the polls, where the majority was <i>seemingly</i> increased
against us&mdash;but manifested in the spirit with which our
people everywhere received the tidings. Until this
spirit became manifest, it might be said our hopes were
even wavering; but forthwith an unwonted confidence
in our success has spread abroad. The sagacious Mr.
Doubleday, whose face may be called the barometer
of our party, and to whom we all look for predictions
of the future, now wears a countenance wreathed in
smiles, and tells us that, from what he knows of the
changeableness of that State, "we may make ourselves
altogether certain of the victory in the fall."</p>

<p>In running over the events of the day, nothing is
more deserving of our animadversion than the ostentatious
display, by the British Federal Tory Whigs,
of the <i>changes</i> among the people against the New-Light
Democracy;&mdash;as if here and there the change
of some recreant Democrat, who is afraid to follow his
leader and chooses to have opinions of his own, could
stay the mighty torrent of attachment to the fortunes
of our chief. We do not deny these changes; but
rather rejoice that men, so little worthy of being called
true Quods, should leave our standard to the tried
soldiers who have marched behind it in all its vicissitudes,
and fought its battles through the whole field
of political experiment. By such only can our glorious
cause be upheld. But we can recount changes as well
as they.</p>

<p>I might select thousands from our newspapers; and
I forbear to do so only because I think it unworthy of
the good sense of a Quod to parade the names of converts
to our party; thus assimilating, as it were, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
people to a flock of sheep, and expecting that more will
follow because many have gone before.</p>

<p>There is, however, one case which I am sure I shall
be excused for bringing before my reader. It is that
of the Dibble family of Wisconsin. It was brought to
the notice of our Central Committee by Zachary
Younghusband, who came into possession of the original
manuscript through a brother Postmaster, Mr. Straddle,
who resides in the neighborhood of the converted family,
and who, in fact, was the amanuensis used upon the
occasion. Our committee thought this document of
sufficient importance to be copied into the Whole Hog;
from whence it is likely to be transferred into every
New-Light Democratic paper of the country. It certainly
exhibits very conclusive as well as very abundant
reasons for change; and may be said to contain the
best epitome of the popular objections of the New
Lights to the election of General Harrison which has
yet appeared in print. An aged and widowed father
with five sons&mdash;all heretofore steeped to the lips in the
slough of British Whiggery&mdash;have had the independence
to rise, in the majesty of freemen, and boldly assert
the highest prerogative of an American citizen&mdash;the
right of thinking, speaking, and voting in such manner
as a patriotic, disinterested New-Light Postmaster,
whose opinions are above all suspicion, might direct
them. The letter of this never-sufficiently-to-be-admired
family will speak for itself. I have only to
remark that, in transcribing it, I have taken the
liberty to correct, what indeed I must call, some
glaring faults in the orthography&mdash;which are to be
attributed solely to Mr. Straddle, the Postmaster, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
reduced the instrument to writing, and who, by-the-by,
let me say, should be advised to give more of his attention
to the useful art of spelling&mdash;but in no other point
altering word, syllable, or letter.</p>

<p>It it is somewhat fancifully headed</p>

<div class="blockquot"><h3>"GO IT, YE CRIPPLES!</h3>

<p>"This is to give notice, that we who have put our

five white men as slaves off his plantation, and <i>is</i> for

<p>This letter, it will be admitted by all unprejudiced
persons, bears the most expressive testimony to the

<p>Upon the adjournment of Congress, late in July, the
Hon. Middleton Flam returned to Quodlibet, to infuse
new energy into our indefatigable committee. Through
him we were apprised of many matters of deep interest
touching the progress of the Campaign, which
was now growing amazingly active. Being in the confidence
of the President and Amos Kendall, he could
tell us divers things which were not intrusted to the
party at large; and let us into the secrets of the little
and big wheels which were at work in Washington and
other places.</p>

<p>These communications were generally of a character
to increase the already sufficient confidence of the
party in the re-election of the President, and still more,
if possible, endear him to the multitudinous friends
who expected, in that event, to receive the long-sought
and well-earned rewards due to their personal devotion
to his cause. Mr. Flam had surveyed the whole field
of contest, and had arrived at an accuracy of information
in regard to the vote of each State&mdash;and, indeed,
of almost every county in the Union&mdash;that, to the
unstudied in such matters, would appear to be miraculous&mdash;very
little short of the gift of prophecy. It is
astonishing to see what proficiency an old and practiced
politician arrives at in predicting, months beforehand,
the precise majorities of the Democratic party over all
other parties, in every election, and especially in settling
the result of a Presidential election. Our sagacious
member on this occasion assured us, greatly to
our exhilaration, that we should see, in the Western
and Southern State elections which were about to take
place, a most triumphant vindication of the administra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>tion,
as well as a most conclusive evidence of the hold
which the President has gained upon the affections of
the people. "Indiana," he said, "is undoubtedly with
us by an overwhelming majority; Kentucky is redeemed,
regenerated, and disenthralled, beyond a
shadow of doubt&mdash;(a favorite oratorical expression of
his;) and North Carolina is prepared to hurl the
thunderbolts of her contemptuous scorn against British
Whiggery, with the red right hand of an offended
Jove. Depend upon what I tell you, gentlemen. I
have carefully surveyed the field. I am not accustomed
to speak without knowledge. I am never
mistaken."</p>

<p>Assured and invigorated by these encouraging words,
we accordingly wait with cheerful trust in the coming
event.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some nervous New Lights affect to see signs of alarm
in the unwonted disquietude of the President. Rumors
reach us that he does not sleep well; that he writes
many letters, slightly variant in sentiment, to opposite
sections of the Union; that he manifests symptoms
of an over-excited zeal to demonstrate the exceedingly
prosperous condition of the party. Besides this, the
Vice-President, it is said, thinks it his duty "to take
the stump," which is considered rather an ominous
departure from "the usages of the Democratic party,"
and, in fact, is looked upon as a proof that our leaders
are growing a little faint-hearted. But what can be
more consistent with the principles and professions of
the New-Light creed? Have we not exploded Mr.
Jefferson's old and unprofitable notion, that the office-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>holders
ought not to interfere with the freedom of the
elective franchise? Is it not a fundamental point in
our philosophy that the offices are "the spoils," and that
the men who hold them owe it to themselves and their
posterity to fight for them in every way known to
Democratic warfare?&mdash;How appropriate then is it that
our highest and greatest officers, having the largest
stake, should be in the very front of the battle! Is it
not especially incumbent on the President, being the
illustrious head of the unterrified new Democracy, to
show a laudable anxiety for the issues of the campaign,
to write letters suited to every emergency, to
rectify constitutional mistakes, and to mystify every
unpleasant fact that might have a tendency to divide the
party or discourage its hopes? If he did not diligently
devote himself to such work he would not be worthy
of that high place we have assigned him in the Quodlibetarian
school.</p>

<p>Mr. Flam, moreover, assures us that the President
has a profound faith in "the intelligence and firmness
of the people," and is unwearied in his endeavors to
make that clear to the most careless or indifferent observer.
Mr. Flam himself urges it upon the Club as
highly important; that we should give great prominence
to this idea of an absolute belief in the intelligence of
the people. He reminds us, that it is a cardinal maxim
in the tactics of the New Lights, when a politician
or a party is suspected of any unwholsome opinion, to
repel the effect of this suspicion by frequent affirmation
and repetition of words and sentiments which in
the popular judgment shall be held to contradict it.</p>

<p>Another card in the game our member recom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>mends
on the same august authority: that is, to dwell
persistently upon the <i>Federalism</i> of our opponents, and
to speak of it, on all occasions, as a term of "ignominy
and insult," by which, he says, many virtuous
and innocent-minded Democrats may be beguiled into
the belief that none of our chief and most authoritative
leaders ever belonged to that venerable party
which once gloried in the name of Federalists.</p>

<p>These and many other valuable suggestions were communicated
by our Honorable Representative to the Club,
as matters of moment in the conduct of our affairs.</p>

<p>It is wonderful to contemplate the influence of these
master-minds upon our Quodlibetarian friends. The
President scarcely drops a sentiment from his pen before
it becomes as it were expanded into the common
air of Democracy. The Globe usually leads off: the
Whole Hog follows; and upon their heels the Scrutinizer,
with all the rank and file of typographs, brings
up a glorious chorus of repetition which leaves no hill
or valley, mountain or plain in the whole land uninstructed
in the Presidential utterances. Thus is it,
even now, with this tribute to the <i>intelligence</i> and
<i>firmness</i> of the people, and this stigma of <i>ignominy</i>
and <i>insult</i> upon the old Federalists.</p>

<p>The Hon. Middleton Flam, Theodore Fog, Agamemnon
Flag, and Zachary Younghusband, (for Zachary
has turned orator of late,) and, without vaunting, I
myself may say that the importance of the crisis has
even, on same recent occasions, placed me in the same
category&mdash;we all give breath to the same sentiment in
speeches by day and by night, and "the same keynote,"
to quote a studied and prepared figure of speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
from an admirable oration delivered last week by Agamemnon
Flag in front of the Iron Railing&mdash;"The
same key note of the <i>Intelligence of the People</i> rings
in the discourses of five thousand Orators, and jangles
in twenty thousand resolutions of New-Light Democratic
Clubs from the St. Croix to the Sabine; and
through all the windings of its devious way the <i>Ignominy
and the Insult of Federalism</i> murmur on the
ear in inseparable treble accompaniment."</p>

<h3>POSTSCRIPT.</h3>

<p>We have just received in Quodlibet the news from
Kentucky, Indiana, and North Carolina. We are lost
in amazement! Our cause is no longer in doubt.
Whatever misgivings we may have heretofore entertained,
all have vanished. The majorities Mr. Doubleday
accounts for in the most satisfactory manner,&mdash;and
though ostensibly on the side of the British
Whigs, they have yet been obtained in such a manner
as to render us perfectly certain of success "in
the Fall."</p>

<p>Nim Porter offers an even bet of one thousand dollars
on the result, and is willing to increase it to ten.</p>

<h3>SECOND POSTSCRIPT.</h3>

<p>Alabama, Illinois, and Missouri, are <i>in</i>, at the office
of the Whole Hog. Eliphalet Fox is stark mad with
delirious joy. To outward appearance something is
gained by the enemy; but Mr. Doubleday says it is
altogether illusory, and that, in fact, he has never been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
truly confident until now. He repeats his assurance,
that we must, from the signs, inevitably carry all before
us "in the Fall."</p>

<p>Nim Porter is willing to double his bets.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>THIRD POSTSCRIPT.</h3>

<p><i>Longo Intervallo.</i></p>

<p>The great election is over. Harrison is elected!!!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I can write no more at present. I crave time to
compose myself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Ten at Night.</span>&mdash;The Club is in session. How blank,
dreary, and long visaged!</p>

<p>We all feel the calamity, but say little.</p>

<p>Mr. Snuffers is terribly exercised. He thinks the
catastrophe is to be attributed to that unhappy split
of the party on the Iron Railing:&mdash;blames Theodore
Fog for pressing that point too hard on Ag Flag and
his friends.</p>

<p>Theodore Fog is greatly exasperated at this remark,
and threatens to make a speech next week to explain
his views: says he has known all along that Harrison
would be elected,&mdash;adding, to the consternation of every
one,&mdash;"<span class="smcap lowercase">AS HE DESERVED TO BE!</span>" He affirms angrily,
"no party could get on with that <span class="smcap lowercase">ABSURD(!)</span> Two-Third's
Rule, which," he says, "is a flagrant abnegation,
repudiation, and fundamental and atrocious violation
of the old, ancient, and veteran usages of the
Democratic party." He adds, with extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
bitterness of expression and violence of gesticulation,
pointing his finger at the Hon. Middleton Flam, who
had just entered the club-room, "I can name the
wr-r-retched intriguer who got it up. As Nathan said
unto David&mdash;Thou art the man!"</p>

<p>Great confusion in the Club. Mr. Flam grows red
in the face. Several members start from their seats.
Mr. Flam shakes his fist at Theodore Fog, and calls
him <span class="smcap">an Abolitionist</span>! He would have uttered other
epithets, but Mr. Doubleday catches him in his arms
and holds his hand close over Mr. F.'s mouth. Fog
fiercely retorts on Mr. Flam, and vociferates in the
rudest tone&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Federalist!</span>"&mdash;He jerks off his cravat
in a highly exasperated manner, evidently threatening
a personal assault. Nim Porter seizes him by the
shoulders, and whirls him into a corner, ejaculating,
"The., don't make a fool of yourself!"</p>

<p>The uproar is at its height, when Thomas G. Winkelman,
with great presence of mind, blows out the
lights. The consequence is, an abrupt adjournment
and a hurried and excited departure of the members
from the hall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Next Morning.</span>&mdash;All Quodlibet is in a state of unparalleled
disorder. It is reported that Theodore Fog
has gone over to Harrison. Many True Grits have
taken the same path.</p>

<p>This is the second great Split of the Democratic
party. The Hon. Middleton Flam says it cannot possibly
stand a third.</p>

<p>Quis, talia fando, temperet a lachrymis!</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gentle</span> reader, I have performed my covenant.
Quod meum fuit prstiti. What content these chronicles,
and the poor skill with which they are set forth,
may have brought to our respectable committee, I am
in no position to decide; since I know that an author
is seldom honestly commended to his face. That there
is division of opinion on this matter I am aware; for
upon the reading at the last meeting on Wednesday
night, I could not fail to observe certain signs of dissent,
if not of displeasure, passing between Eliphalet
Fox and Zachary Younghusband; and <i>that</i> more than
once. But Mr. Flam, who has always shown himself
a true friend and patron to me, took up my cause with
such spirit and effect, being well supported by Mr.
Doubleday and Mr. Snuffers, that a unanimous vote
of approbation was finally passed by the committee.
Thus sheltered under the shield of triple brass and
tough bull hide of our Grand Central Committee,
I cheerfully submit my labors to the judgment of the
good folks of Quodlibet; promising, if they approve
and should again call me to the desk, to contribute
what my opportunity may allow to the better elucidation
of their character, both social and public, wherein
it is manifest an eager desire to be instructed hath
lately grown up in this nation. Non sum qui oblivionis
artem, quam memori mallem.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
